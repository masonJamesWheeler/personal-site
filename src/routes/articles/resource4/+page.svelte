      Specialists in politics and administration — both within and outside of
government—are forging closer working relationships as part of
policy-making processes through New Media networks variously known as
web blogs , portals and wikis. These and other internet links allow
contact between computer or smart phone users, exchange of information
and the formation of mutually supportive issue networks as alternatives to
information provided by traditional business, government and media
sources (Barlow, 2007a; 2007b; Feld and Wilcox, 2008; Gill, 2004;
Kahler, 2009). Portals such as the USA.gov website are organized from a
citizen-centric perspective. The website is a virtual one-stop-shop to
government services and information.2 In the pre-internet era, citizens
would have to contact individual government offices to apply for and
receive information — a time-consuming task which would discourage all
but the most tenacious. The one-stop-shops, whether they are virtual or
physical, represent an organizational change from department-task
orientation to citizen-oriented service. Blogging and social networking
have accelerated this trend and become pervasive sources of citizen
participation covering a wide range of political and social issues.
Although its full influence is still unknown, millions of participants in
the developing public space or “blogosphere” are influencing political
processes by acting as grassroots observers, reporters, reviewers and
fact-checkers (Gill, 2004: 5; Habermas, 1991; Keren, 2006; Richardson,
2006). Citizens are using blogs, e-mail, smart phones and social
networking to participate in web-based political and social activities and
express their views and positions on a wide range of policy issues. This new
type of amateur journalism and political and social commentary challenges
established news outlets and opinion sources by promoting a more open,
participatory culture in nearly every aspect of society. As a result, demand
for expertise in decision making and policy analysis has increased,
reflecting human resource systems based on job-related competence,
expanded ICT networks and the need for advanced knowledge of New
Media technologies. At the same time, interest groups, politicians and
public officials are also applying these same technologies to conduct
political campaigns, communicate with constituents and recruit new
members and voters (Hill, 2009; Miller, 2008). Mastery of the new
technology—in all its forms—has become a virtual prerequisite for
successful lobbying, winning political campaigns and providing better
service to constituents (Chapter 2).
The 2008 U.S. presidential election represented a major breakthrough
in the application of New Media technologies to politics and political
campaigns. The extensive use of ICTs for political communication began

even earlier with former presidential candidate Howard Dean’s failed run
for the presidency in 2004 (Hindman, 2006). After being appointed
Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair in 2005, Dean (together
with President Obama’s tech-savvy campaign advisers) used ICTs so
effectively during the Democrats’ grassroots 2008 campaign that they
may have significantly impacted the results of the presidential election.
Chapter 2 shows how this type of e-campaigning uses ICTs as a means to
disseminate information, mobilize volunteers, raise funds and otherwise
pursue electioneering functions (Garson, 2006: 69–72). Plainly, ICTs
played a significant role in promoting additional citizen participation
during the recent U.S. elections. The causal linkages between decision
making, fund raising, party identification, political activism, social
networking and voter turnouts are more difficult to establish with
precision: they are currently being explored in more depth by communica-
tions experts and political scientists. Recent studies suggest that more
Americans are using ICTs to access information, ask questions and receive
government services online (Pew Internet and American Life Project,
2010 ).
