    The present study explores how aged out foster youth discursively construct home in light
of their experiences before, during, and/or after aging out of foster care. Results from 30
interviews with aged out foster youth revealed three primary themes represented participants’ sensemaking around home: home as a place (where), home as family, and home as
self. The current study offers unique theoretical and practical implications for researchers
and professionals who work with foster youth during their transition out of care. Limitations and directions for future research are presented.

I don’t know. I think that in a sense I was always yearning for what I have now. So
I wanted to create what I have now. For me [home] was an idea of something that
I didn’t have. Sometimes it was literally something I didn’t have physically, or
sometimes it was something I did not have an emotional connection to …
I definitely didn’t have stability. I didn’t have consistency. I didn’t have reliable
adults. I didn’t have good positive relationships. I didn’t have good friendships.
I didn’t have sometimes physically a home … so home was something that I was
always searching for.

From a place to a feeling, to people, objects, and one’s own creation, as highlighted
in human experience and argued by scholars, home is laden with several multifaceted
meanings. Chawla and Holman Jones (2015) introduce home as “definable and
indefinable,” stating, “Beyond being experienced as a place, a space, a structure,
home is also memory, feeling, and affect” (p. xi). Indeed, scholars have positioned
home in myriad ways. Psychologically, research has revealed home is related to
feelings of security, values, and privacy (Depres, 1991). Sociologically, home is the
locus for family life and a place of relaxation, safety, freedom, and self-expression
(Somerville, 1997). For those nearing the end of life, home equates to being near
family members and is often regarded as a safe place (Collier, Phillips, & Ledema,
2015). In experiences of homesickness, home is often defined not only as a physical
space but also by a sense of comfort, emerging from feelings of safety and love
(Scharp, Paxman, & Thomas, 2016).
The absence of home, or homelessness, can also inform conceptualizations of
home. According to the McKinney-Vento Homelessness Assistant Act, homeless
youth are those “who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence” (U.S.
Interagency Council on Homelessness, 2018: p. 1). This can include children/youth
living in hotels, camping grounds, shelters, cars, parks, abandoned buildings, or
awaiting care placements (U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, 2018). Per the
Act, home equates to a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) refers to this definition of
homelessness as literal homelessness, noting that individuals can also experience
imminent risks of homelessness, homelessness under Federal statutes, and fleeing
and/or attempting to flee housing due to domestic violence (U.S. Interagency
Council on Homelessness, 2018). Drawing on these and other varied themes of
home and homelessness, from stable location/proximity to positive relationships/
family to comfort/safety/adequacy, Chawla and Holman Jones (2015) posit, “What is
sure is that the experience of home – in its presence or absence, in its materiality or
lack thereof – lies in the stories of those who tell it” (p. xi, emphasis in original). As
such, the present study takes an interpretive approach to understand what home
means in the stories of individuals with the shared experience of having lived in, and
then having “aged out” (i.e., reached legal adulthood and transitioned out of care
while neither reunified with family of origin nor adopted), of the U.S. foster care
system.
Discursively Constructing Family and Home
Given the goal of illuminating meanings – or constructions – of home that emerge in
talk, the present study is couched in a framework of social constructionism, specifically Galvin’s (2006, 2014) work on families as discourse dependent. Social constructionists who examine storied experiences aim to illuminate how people create
realities through communication (Gergen, 1985; Leeds-Hurwitz, 2006). Social constructionists posit that communication is the tool by which individuals talk realities
Western Journal of Communication 175
into being; social interaction constructs identities, shapes realities, and allows for
sensemaking (Gergen, 2003; Leeds-Hurwitz, 2006). Similarly, embedded in social
constructionism, Galvin’s (2006, 2014) framework of discourse dependency promotes examining the ways in which families rely on social interaction to (de)
construct and (de)legitimize relationships. In discourse dependency, “discourse”
carries dual meanings. Whereas Galvin focuses on communicative acts and processes
that emerge in social interaction (i.e., discourse), the talk/texts that arise from social
interaction are reliant upon, and saturated with, cultural ideology (i.e., Discourse)
(see Baxter, 2014; Galvin, 2014). Indeed, scholars of discourse dependency emphasize that, although all families are socially constructed and thus rely on discourse for
their creation and maintenance, as families move away from ideologically dominant
frameworks of family (e.g., Discourses of shared biology, legal ties, co-residence),
they bear greater communicative burdens to create and convey family identity. In
turn, creating distance and deconstructing assumed ties among those who fulfill
ideological understandings of family also requires more discursive work to garner
legitimization in the absence of a culturally assumed relationship (see Scharp &
Thomas, 2016). Indeed, when family ties stray from Discourses of family, they are
increasingly reliant on discourse for (de)construction and (de)legitimization.
Like family – indeed all meanings/identities – the meaning of home is socially
constructed via d/Discourse. Social interaction is the foundation for constructing,
repairing, and changing identities and understandings of home (see Carey, 1989),
and these meanings are laden with ideology. Thus, social constructionism, via
discourse dependency, is a fruitful framework for examining the ways in which
home garners meaning in talk, or d/Discourse. Of particular interest at present are
(formerly) fostered youth. Given that fostered youth have often transitioned into and
out of multiple homes, resided in familial arrangements with various individuals,
and experienced maltreatment and/or heightened risk for negative outcomes
throughout their time in care, their experiences of family and home deviate from
cultural expectations of family life (i.e., permanence, ongoing genetic ties, closeness;
see Floyd, Mikkelson, & Judd, 2006). In turn, the stories of aged out foster youth
(AOFY) likely construct, repair, and/or change meanings of home in light of these
experiences.
Foster Care as a Site for Examining “Home”
Instability is a hallmark of many fostered youth’s lives before, during, and after
care. Although many families experience significant transitions (e.g., blended
families, military families, families dealing with chronic illness), the multitude
of transitions (i.e., into and out of familial relationships; among various homes
and schools) faced by foster youth brand the foster experience as uniquely
complex. Fostered youth are the most at-risk youth group in the United States,
facing safety-related issues and/or maltreatment as well as social/behavioral,
mental/emotional, and physical health issues, which prompt unique challenges
176 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
faced by fostered youth (see Kools, Paul, Norbeck, & Robbins, 2009; Nelson,
2017; Thomas, 2015). Additionally, cultural ideology positions family as providing children with care, safety, and shelter – until and even beyond adulthood –
alongside placement with a permanent family as associated with better outcomes
for fostered youth. Thus, the relational disruption, placement impermanence, and
unsafe conditions faced by foster youth run counter to both cultural expectations
of growing up and public policy efforts to reunify foster children with biological
parents, simultaneously limiting placement transitions (e.g., Thomas, Jackl, &
Crowley, 2017).
Fostered youth, particularly those who “age out,” face myriad challenges upon
exiting the foster care system (Courtney et al., 2016); an estimated 20,010 youth
aged out of the U.S. foster care system in FY 2020 alone (Adoption and Foster
Care Analysis Reporting System [AFCARS], 2021). Wave 2 findings from the
CalYOUTH study (i.e., longitudinal research evaluating outcomes of extending
foster care beyond age 18) revealed that within one year of aging out, 11.8% of
fostered youth had lived in five or more places, and 18.3% experienced homelessness (Courtney et al., 2016). Factors associated with housing instability and
homelessness include physical and sexual victimization, emotional and behavioral
problems, criminal convictions, and dropping out of high school (Fowler, Toro,
& Miles, 2009).
Although social workers and family practitioners are keenly aware of the circumstances facing fostered youth and extensively research best practices to improve
youth outcomes, little is known about how AOFY discursively construct and make
sense of their experiences (Nelson, 2017; Nelson & Horstman, 2017). Communication-focused scholarship has much to contribute, given that diversity (e.g., socioeconomical, racial, ethnical) and complexity (e.g., multiple and severed familial ties,
life course transition/rupture) heighten the role of communication in (de)constructing and (de)legitimizing foster care and foster family relationships (see Galvin, 2006,
2014; Nelson & Colaner, 2020; Thomas et al., 2017). Indeed, scholars have studied
relational implications surrounding the instability and challenges faced by foster
youth, including what family means to formerly fostered youth (see Thomas et al.,
2017), yet research has not focused on how such complexities might impact other
culturally pervasive objects, such as conceptualizations of home. Of particular interest at present, the challenges and transitions experienced before, during, and aftercare likely underpin complex discursive constructions of home for AOFY. Thus,
grounded in social constructionism (Berger & Luckmann, 1967; Gergen, 1985) and
discourse dependency (Galvin, 2006, 2014), the current study seeks to examine how
AOFY discursively construct home.
Home in Foster Contexts and Beyond
Given that AOFY often encounter negative events and experiences regarding each of
these facets (i.e., location/proximity transitions and impermanence, relational
Western Journal of Communication 177
interruptions/negative relationships/shifting family boundaries, unsafe and inadequate living conditions), it becomes imperative to better understand how these
experiences might impact stories and constructions of home. Nuanced understanding of AOFY’s sensemaking around home can provide much-needed insight into
how the foster care system impacts foster youth’s lives during and beyond youth’s
time in the system.
Extant literature provides glimpses into how home is defined, yet these lists of
meanings often do not regard broader contexts, which inevitably shape meanings of
home (Tester & Wingfield, 2013). Researchers contend, “it is important to explain
the concept of ‘home’ as it is understood in different contexts by different people”
(Easthope, 2004: p. 135), rather than trying to create one definition of home that can
work in all contexts and for all people (Tester & Wingfield, 2013). The majority of
AOFY belong to historically minoritized racial groups, have lower-class SES, and
have spent a significant amount of their childhood outside of the nuclear family
model (see AFCARS, 2021). These characteristics, coupled with 18.3% of AOFY
experiencing homelessness within one year of aging out (Courtney et al., 2016),
necessitate deeper understandings of how home is communicatively constructed and
navigated within this particular population – not only to expand current scholarly
conceptualizations of home but to illuminate the ways in which foster care, as an
institution, might impact the home lives of AOFY for years to come. Such knowledge holds implications for child welfare professionals and family communication
researchers alike – both those who have a voice in home life decisions for youth
within and beyond care and those privileging diverse voices to conceptualize home
in scholarship, respectively.
The Present Study
Taken together, AOFY’s experiences often run counter to both cultural expectations
and foster care policy goals. Therefore, stories assist in making sense of experiences
and construct d/Discursive meanings of multifaceted semantic objects such as home.
Examining how AOFY’s talk constructs home before, during, and after aging out of
care is integral to better understanding the foster youth experience, an essential step
toward assisting in establishing home for youth aging out of the foster care system.
Elucidating discursive constructions of home might enable professionals to better
assist foster youth upon their transition from care as they begin navigating life on
their own. Indeed, home is one facet of life, which offers a sense of identity,
belonging, and safety (see Collier et al., 2015; Scharp et al., 2016). Thus, we present
the following research question:
RQ1: How is home discursively constructed in aged out foster youth’s (AOFY’s)
talk?
178 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
Method
Sample
Participants were 30 individuals (N = 30) who aged out of the United States
foster care system within the past 10 years (M = 4.9 years, SD = 3.7). Of the
sample, 22 were female (73.3%), 7 were male (23.3%), and 1 was transgender
(3.3%), with ages ranging from 19 to 30 years old (M = 24.1, SD = 3.7). Most
participants identified as Black (n = 10, 33.3%), with nine identifying as bi-racial
(30.0%), seven as White (23.3%), two as Hispanic (6.6%), and two as multi-racial
(6.6%). Participants spent between 2 and 20 years in the system (M = 9.7, SD =
5.9) and reported experiencing three to 154 placements while in care (Median = 7).
When asked about their current living situation, 17 participants reported that
they were renting an apartment, townhouse, or home (56.6%), five reported
owning their own home (16.6%), two reported that they were staying in transitional housing (6.6%), two reported that they were staying with host families
(6.6%), two reported residence in student housing (6.6%), and two reported being
homeless (6.6%). Of the 30 participants, 20 (66.7%) reported they had experienced homelessness since aging out of care, nine (30.0%) reported they did not
experience homelessness, and one (3.3%) opted not to respond.
Procedures
Upon obtaining IRB approval, participants were recruited via Facebook groups and
pages as well as through snowball sampling techniques (i.e., networking sampling;
word of mouth). To better understand the experiences of AOFY, the first author
conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews (Baxter & Babbie, 2004). The goal of
each interview was to garner rich descriptions about AOFY’s family and homerelated experiences and understandings. Specifically, each participant was asked
a number of questions during the interview process related to their experience and
meanings of home including, “What does home mean to you?,” and “How would
you describe home: before you entered foster care? While you were in foster care?
Upon aging out of foster care?” All interviews took place over the phone and ranged
from 47 to 117 minutes; each participant received a $20 Amazon e-gift card via
e-mail upon completion of the interview. Interviews were audio-recorded and
transcribed verbatim by the first author, resulting in 538 pages of single-spaced text.
Data Analysis
We used inductive analysis to answer the guiding heuristic question: “What is
home?” Specifically, we followed Braun and Clarke’s (2006) six steps for thematic
analysis. First, we familiarized ourselves with the data by reading the transcripts
multiple times, recording ideas, and taking notes. Second, we generated initial
codes by identifying segments of text that helped to answer the heuristic
Western Journal of Communication 179
question. Third, we searched for broad themes among the initial codes and
matched potential themes with relevant coded data extracts (i.e., potential exemplars). In accordance with Owen (1984), we applied the criteria of recurrence
(i.e., when the same idea or meaning was expressed), repetition (i.e., when key
words, phrases or sentences were repeated), and forcefulness (i.e., when ideas
were emphasized through vocal inflection, volume, or dramatic pauses) to identify themes. After coalescing codes into broad themes, we reviewed and refined
the themes to reflect the overarching meanings of home that emerged from the
dataset. Throughout analysis, we employed the constant comparative analysis
technique (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), whereby each code and then each theme
was compared with all others to determine whether themes denoted similar or
different meanings. Fifth, we detailed and labeled each theme and any subthemes
within. Finally, after verifying the findings, we produced the final report by
describing each theme and choosing exemplars for each.
Verification Procedures
Five verification procedures were employed: audit trail, peer verification via investigator triangulation and data conferencing, member checking, and thick descriptions. First, to ensure that our analysis process can be understood by others, we kept
detailed notes of codes and decisions throughout our analysis process, thus producing an audit trail (see Lincoln & Guba, 1985). To illustrate the validity of findings,
the authors engaged investigator triangulation by conducting independent analyses
followed by comparing preliminary findings. In addition, after completing the initial
analysis, the first author led a data conferencing session, wherein scholars in related
areas of study assessed and validated the analytic findings (see Braithwaite, Allen, &
Moore, 2017; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Three scholars with expertise in qualitative
methods, foster families, family communication, and/or social constructionism participated in the data conferencing session. All scholars involved with the peer
verification procedures generally agreed upon the preliminary findings; these processes yielded only minor edits, such as renaming themes (e.g., home as a physical
space was renamed home as a place to better reflect participants’ constructions/
language use).
To ensure that those who belong to the group being studied also perceive the
findings as representative of their experiences and understandings, the first
author conducted member checks of the results (see Creswell, 2007). Each
participant was sent an e-mail with a summary of the findings and was asked
to indicate whether each theme was representative of their experience. If they did
not believe a theme was representative of their experience, they were instructed
to explain why that was the case. Of the 30 participants who were emailed, 12
responded and unanimously confirmed that the findings were representative of
their experiences.
180 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
Finally, vivid exemplars (e.g., thick description and quotations) support each
theme and provide possible transferability of findings to other AOFY (see Lincoln
& Guba, 1985). Rich, detailed accounts of each theme were provided to allow readers
to assess whether the findings speak to them and across similar social contexts.
Moreover, by capturing the voices of AOFY, their experiences can be better understood by readers. Taken together, these procedures allow for scholarly, in-group, and
lay verification of the findings.
Results
The purpose of this study was to better understand what home means to AOFY.
Thematic analysis revealed that three primary themes animated participants’ talk of
home: home as a place (where), home as family, and home as self. Of note, most
participants did not describe home solely as a place, family, or self. Rather, participants’ talk often drew on multiple themes to make sense of home. Each theme is
discussed below.
Home as a Place (Where)
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many participants’ talk constructed home as a place. However, home is not simply a location; instead, for aged-out foster youth, home is
similar to bell hooks’ (2009) discussion of place as a return to belonging, a site where:
one feels, one recognizes, and one’s heart feels and knows. Subthemes of the present
study, too, illustrate home as where—where one’s physical needs are met (site of
shelter), where one has emotional ties and feels as though they are welcome and
should be present (site of belonging), and where one can engage routines and figure
out ways of fulfilling expectations (site of consistency).
Site of Shelter
As posited, unique experiences of AOFY influenced talk of home. Although many
individuals frame home as “more than just” shelter, participants explicated the
ways in which prior experiences shaped minimal expectations. For example, Lucy
talked about how home was stripped back to the “the basics” because neither
shelter nor food was ever guaranteed before entering foster care: “So sometimes
I would have to sleep outside under the porch or find a youth shelter to live in,
and I remember having to break into the neighbor’s house just to get some food.
I figured I got a pass … ” (3). Thus, home became the place where she found
food or was able to sleep for a night, whether it was under a porch or at a youth
shelter. Although food and shelter are often positioned as fundamental needs –
after living through their absence – food, sleep, and survival became markers not
just of needs but of home for AOFY. As Paul succinctly stated: “[Home is] where
you rest your head, it’s where you have food, it’s where you have clothes on your
back … ” (Paul, 9).
Western Journal of Communication 181
Maya, too, described a particular site of needs fulfillment: “I literally picture
a house to sleep and eat and live in” (Maya, 2). Other participants drew on fosterrelated experiences as reasons for describing home as a shelter
I think when you turn 18 or 19 I think a home, it can even be a place you can lay
your head. Because sometimes some [fostered youth] are just homeless a lot … so
even a place to lay your head can be a dream come true. (Adam, 25)
Although Adam never experienced homelessness himself, while working with foster
youth, he became aware of the importance of having a place to sleep. While some
might take a place to sleep for granted, AOFY recognize the important role of home
as a site of shelter. Indeed, as illustrated in participants’ accounts, individuals might
not appreciate the value in something until they no longer have it. For some, a place
to eat, sleep, and store clothes – a site of shelter – was not always guaranteed,
especially for those dealing with or keenly aware of others’ homelessness. Thus,
home became a place where one finds shelter, where one’s needs are even minimally
met.
Site of Belonging
Participants also branched out from mere basic needs, describing home as a place
where one feels a sense of belonging. Home as a site of belonging, or a space wherein
one can nest, still points to the structure of home, as a physical space in which one
can create/encounter an affective experience (see Chawla & Holman Jones, 2015).
Within this space, one feels welcome and at ease – something that AOFY do not
always feel while transitioning among homes and families. For example, Rose
described home as a place to call one’s own, whether a house or apartment or room:
Mainly it’s just my room again. It’s like … home is where I am me and my stuff
looks like me and everything around me is me. You know? I have my favorite
things on the walls … my posters I like, my movies … you know? (11)
The ability to decorate, store belongings, and look around and have everything feel
like a reflection of themselves were important aspects of belonging to Rose and
others. This environmental and affective belonging stands in stark contrast to the
transitional days of foster care. While in care, youth were required to store their
limited possessions in a single bag – often a trash bag – that would accompany them
from placement to placement, highlighting change and impermanence rather than
belonging. Some participants further detailed the difficulty in experiencing belonging
when living in foster placements:
Home is supposed to be a place where we belong, and in some cases we never
really feel like we belong. We feel like we are outsiders and we will never be good
enough to belong. (Faith, 26)
Reflecting on their time in care, participants’ talk incorporated a temporal aspect of
belonging as well, marking home as a site where one can settle in and create
memories. As Kayla stated
182 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
A home in my sense is … where you have memories, you have rooms that you go
into and it has all your decorations, the smell of the house, the vibes are great, you
know, everything about it makes you feel like you’re in your safe haven. So that’s
what home means to me. (Kayla, 23)
Throughout the data corpus, possessions, spaces, and passage of time are all tied to
feelings of belonging, especially in foster care, where possessions are limited and
might shift with each placement. In addition to senses that cue belonging, including
smells, sights, sounds, and feeling safe, participants described aspects of home that
they missed, as well as memories that still tied them to specific places. As Faith
explained:
We had Christmas there, we did Thanksgiving dinner, me and my brother fought
like cats and dogs, we got yelled at, we got whoopins in that house, we got potty
trained in that house … [laughing] Everything a little child experiences was all in
that house! I drive by that house today and I sit outside of it and I just look at it. It
was put up for foreclosure, so I can never claim it unless I buy it. It’s just the
memories … they give me peace. I do miss it. I miss where I grew up and I miss
stuff like that. (26)
Faith and other participants described home as a site of belonging and memorymaking. Home was where participants “did family,” a space that they could envision,
that they missed as they grew older, and that they associated with the good, bad, and
indifferent aspects of childhood. Participants reminisced about these sites of belonging—places they truly felt they could always call home.
Site of Consistency
Given the inconsistencies with the culturally expected life course that fostered youth
have experienced, it makes sense that AOFY described home as a site of consistency.
Participants voiced societal expectations – home life with children involves consistency, routine, and safety – that stood in contrast with their experiences of removal
from a family of origin. Despite children being removed and placed in foster care
due to conditions deemed unsafe/unstable, some participants described their original
house as home, due to the consistency it represented. As Carmen explained:
My family grew up for five generations on the same piece of property and um, it’s
pretty much everyone, they believe that they will always come back. It’s kind of like
the homestead, the home base, no matter where you go in the world you’re gonna
come back to that place cause you know it’s, you know it’s gonna be there. (5)
Participants like Carmen described home as an unwavering and stable place. For
others such as Lucy, home as a place where one experiences consistency was
contrasted with their more chaotic life prior to placement:
It [the time before entering foster care] makes you realize how important it is that
you have the security that you’re going to have a place to sleep. You know, I never
would know until I came back and the doors were locked. I realized home should
be guaranteed and it’s really jarring when it’s not. (3)
Western Journal of Communication 183
While some marked home as a site of consistency connected to biological family
members, others described better understanding what home was not, in light of
being thrust into a more stable home via foster care placement(s). Thus, for many
AOFY, home as a site of consistency was achieved precisely where biological family
members were absent: in foster homes. For example, in referencing his conception of
home during foster care, Todd stated: “Home would be kind of like a place that you
can rely on as a constant … like to go back to” (8). In line with foster care goals,
foster homes are tasked with providing consistency. Thus, despite foster care’s
violation of cultural ideology surrounding family and home (i.e., not long-term
connections; not a permanent and unwavering place[ment]), AOFY explained that
any site of consistency can be home, even foster placements.
Overall, participants’ talk drew upon experiences before, during, and after foster
care to construct home as unwavering, constant, guaranteed, and predictable.
Although some participants voiced culturally privileged configurations of home as
a site of consistency, referencing biological family members and the family homestead, others spoke of home as any place where one experiences consistency in home
life. Regardless, consistency was central to constructing home.
Home as Family
Talk in the previous theme described home as a place where shelter, belonging, and
consistency can be attained; the latter of which points to the present theme where
participants emphasized biological ties. Indeed, some participants emphasized who
over where, describing people, particularly family – interactions and feelings with
and about family members – as a critical aspect of home. Given the placement
inconsistencies (e.g., transitions among homes/caregivers; likelihood of homelessness) experienced by many fostered youths, coupled with cultural understandings of
home as “where the heart is,” it makes sense that fostered youth might speak less to
spaces/places and more to people, especially those constructed as family (see Thomas
et al., 2017), when making sense of home. For example, Kayla stated:
I think home is where the family resides and so to me, it’s kind of like weird, it’s
interconnected in a sense. Obviously, family is different. Family is like people,
home is like a mixture of people, a place, and an object. (23)
Kayla’s talk of home sheds light on the interconnected nature of home and family
while acknowledging that differences between the two might exist. Some participants
further explicated that family was not just an aspect of home; home ceased to exist in
the absence of family. Lucy described them as “interconnected,” explaining, “I would
probably say for me I wouldn’t call a place home if it didn’t have family there. I feel
like they are interconnected” (3). Similarly, participants such as Owen spoke to
family and home as “one in the same” as he differentiated his home from others’
conceptualizations of home:
I view them [family and home] as one in the same. For example, if parents decided
to move and they became homeless I think you can still go home wherever they are
184 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
at, you know, and be part of that family. So, I think they really are one unit. You
know, most people view home as a structure, but I think it’s people. It doesn’t have
to be, like, parents. It can be somebody you view as a sister or a cousin … (17)
As participants’ stories demonstrated, home-as-family is not limited to the parent–
child relationship. Rather, home could be achieved with a variety of individuals who
constitute family. Home as family is reminiscent of Segrin and Flora’s (2018)
transactional definitions of family, wherein family – or in the present study,
home – emerges from “communication among [family member] individuals and
the subjective feelings generated by interactions” (p. 7). Participants’ accounts
further gave voice to the idea that family as home is ever-present, through interactions and feelings, even in situations of homelessness: “I think if you have a family
that wherever your family is, that’s home” (Becca, 15). Rather than describing home
“as where the heart is,” participants described home “as wherever family is.”
Home as Self
In addition to places and family members – or the where and who of home –
AOFY talked of home as self. Given the likelihood of living in multiple placements/places and experiencing familial turnover as well as relational loss, it is
perhaps unsurprising, albeit likely upsetting, that, in the absence of an ability to
rely on particular places or persons as consistent sites of home, creating home in
oneself emerged from participants’ stories. Indeed, much as bell hooks (2001)
positions love as a light within, and radiation from, oneself, participants in the
present study emphasized that home inherently belongs to, and manifests within,
oneself:
I’ve been changing the meaning of it a lot. I want home to be in my own heart, you
know, because I want to love myself that much that I feel comfortable with myself
to be satisfied. (Chad, 7)
Chad and other participants sought home within one’s own mind and body. In this
way, home is positioned as an individual experience, often marked by feelings of
comfort and satisfaction; a stark contrast to descriptions of relational and residential
upheaval. Sadie described home similarly: “I am my home. Um, my heart and my
mind and where I feel most safe is within myself” (Sadie, 29). Sadie gave voice to the
mind as a critical and powerful indicator of home, marked by a feeling of safety.
Participants’ talk further constructed home as self by explicitly referencing home as
a state of being:
Yeah, I think home is um, having peace within yourself, wherever you are, like
being grounded, and being safe and confident … more of a state of being and less
of a place. And I think that, I mean I know a lot of that thinking comes from that
there wasn’t a home, and I had to, you know, exist in the gray area of whatever was
around me, so I think I really created this, like, inner world of reminding myself of
who I am and what I’m about and having peace within me wherever I go in this
world. (Wren, 22)
Western Journal of Communication 185
Participants like Wren built upon the construction of home as belonging in one’s
heart, suggesting that home was inside themselves, independent of spatial domains.
In this way, home travels with the self, no matter where one goes.
As posited, AOFY also explicitly drew from experiences in care to explain their
sensemaking of home. For example, Wren talked about this “gray area” where she
existed because of not having a physical home – which ultimately prompted her to
make sense of home as an inner world she created for herself. Indeed, transition and
turbulence are characteristic of foster care experiences; consequently, positioning
home as self (i.e., “I am my home”) creates discursive space for fostered youth to
maintain a home even when a physical place and/or family is in flux or altogether
absent.
In summation, home was constructed as something that belongs to, manifests in,
and travels with the self by many AOFY. This definition likely arises from the many
uncertainties fostered youth face as well as in response to cultural assumptions that
position home as a consistent site of comfort—a place where one feels safe and
loved, finds belonging and makes memories, and shares with those who are family.
In other words, it appears to be a definition of necessity, rooted in and derived from
transitions and turbulence associated with foster care.
Discussion
Findings illustrate AOFY’s complex home life experiences and associated sensemaking of home. Participants described transitions, turbulence, and homelessness, experiences that are inextricably linked to talk of home as a place
(where one finds shelter, feels belonging, and garners consistency), as family,
and as self. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the following
sections.
Theorizing Discourses of Home
To examine the ways in which home is made sense of – or constituted – in
AOFY’s talk, the present study drew on discourse dependency theorizing (see
Galvin, 2006, 2014), couched in social constructionism (e.g., Berger & Luckman,
1967; Gergen, 1985). Indeed, our findings contribute meaningfully to this theorizing through exemplifying how conceptualizations of home are discursively
arrayed. Within the data corpus, home as tied to a place is positioned as the
dominant ideology of home, with participants providing details of what makes
a place home, including feelings and activities garnered within the physical home
space; that home is often tied to a place is consistent with extant literature (e.g.,
Depres, 1991; Scharp et al., 2016; U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness,
2018) and lay speak—indeed, if one does not have a fixed, regular, and adequate
place to live, they are often described as homeless. Scholars have even posited
that understanding home-as-place(s) can serve to obfuscate the reality of
186 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
homelessness, for those who are technically homeless nonetheless regularly
experience shelter (Garrett, 2015). Similarly, AOFY who conceptualized home
as a place (where) reify cultural hallmarks of home – shelter, consistency, and
belonging – despite, and in light of, the many home life disruptions they
experienced before, during, and after foster care. Indeed, AOFY are not immune
to the cultural pervasiveness of the dominant ideology (i.e., Discourse) of home
as a physical space. By centering this Discourse in their conversations, AOFY
illustrated that, while their personal experiences of home (i.e., often marked by
inconsistent and unstable housing), in many ways, do not exemplify this Discourse, this conceptualization of home was and still is desirable.
However, as our findings demonstrate, even those without a physical space to
call home can still have a home in others and/or themselves. Among many
participants, regardless of physical location, family is what made a space or
feeling home; the two are inseparable. Moreover, participants put forth self as
home – further complicating understandings of home. These two deviations
from the dominant ideology of home illustrate the ways in which housing
instability might lead to unique discursive demands and become particularly
poignant when considered in light of Garrett’s (2015): drawing on Sarah
Ahmed – argument that understandings of home are created largely through
experiences of leaving or losing one’s home. As traditional anchors of home
(i.e., shelter, consistency, belonging) become unstable, understandings of home
are reconstituted. Given that many participants in the current sample experienced placement instability and homelessness, and that formerly fostered young
adults have reported relationship ruptures and diminished sense of self, it
makes sense that home is reconfigured in light of these losses (see Garrett,
2015; Thomas, 2015). Participants drew upon the ways in which they navigated
inconsistency and loss, which corresponded to turning to close others and
looking within for new understandings of what home could be. These conceptualizations were often contrasted with what were marked as pervasive cultural
understandings of home as a place. Although some participants did describe
home as a place, against a backdrop of ongoing instability, AOFY constructed
home as found in others and within themselves, illuminating how deviations
from pervasive cultural understandings of home, as well as experiences of loss,
lead to sensemaking.
Findings illustrate that home, like family, is highly discourse dependent; communication constitutes (a sense of) home, with those straying farther from
culturally expected configurations of place and space requiring more explanation
to create and convey understandings of home. Although describing and garnering
understanding/legitimization of one’s home when labeled as homeless might
require more explanation (discourse), given that it challenges ideology surrounding what can and should be (a) home (Discourse), it is nonetheless possible to
discursively (re)construct family in the absence of, or in addition to, a physical
space. This is especially important for those who, like fostered youth, might
Western Journal of Communication 187
experience place instability and even upheaval/turnover in familial relationships;
even in tumultuous times, one might be able to experience home within oneself.
These discourses of home become pronounced such that even if those outside of
the foster care context have a self-oriented concept of home, they never have to
articulate it assuming material and/or familial home remain stable. Future
research might take a dialectical/dialogic approach to further examine the discourses at play that constitute home in talk of individuals who have experienced
transitions/displacement.
Diversifying Understandings of Home
Because AOFY often experience a variety of home configurations (e.g., foster homes,
group homes, transitional housing, homelessness, etc.), they offered a unique perspective as to where, what, and/or who constituted home and extended research in this
area. Moreover, the demographics of participants in the current sample (i.e., most
participants identified as Black and monthly income was more typical of lower- to
middle-class SES individuals) extended current understandings of home by illuminating the perspectives of those who represent more diverse social identity categories.
Although previous research pointed to home as defined by feelings (see
Scharp et al., 2016), the current study extends this body of work, revealing
that – often when necessary, due to housing instability – home can be housed
within oneself. AOFY described a sense of home inside of themselves, especially
in the absence of spatial domains. Feelings of love, comfort, satisfaction, confidence, peace, and happiness emerged as important to home as self. Participants
also made sense of home as self through referencing a sense of security they felt
internally. Because feeling safe, protected, and worry-free – all unique aspects of
security – are paramount to foster care as an institution (Children’s Bureau,
2017), it is unsurprising that participants drew heavily on their experiences in
foster care when identifying home as self. While prior research has revealed
home is related to feelings of security (Depres, 1991; Scharp et al., 2016), the
current study bolsters this body of work by revealing security, and consequently
home, can be internalized. Taken together, the idea that individuals can establish
a sense of home inside of themselves might serve a buffer for challenges
associated with aging out of care; of primary interest, making sense of home as
self might assist fostered youth in positively adapting to homelessness and social
isolation (see Courtney et al., 2016). Arguably, promoting an internalized sense
of home should not be viewed as a solution to combatting homelessness among
AOFY. Rather, our data suggest that, in light of homelessness, AOFY likely
developed this internalized perspective of home to help combat feelings of
isolation and instability.
Moreover, while home as a physical space has been well documented in prior
research (see Collier et al., 2015; Depres, 1991; Scharp et al., 2016), results from the
current study add to this body of knowledge by suggesting a physical space is
188 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
home insofar as it is a site of function – a place where one finds shelter, belonging,
and/or consistency. Prior research has confirmed belonging is a critical aspect of
home that many foster youth value (Biehal, 2012). Participants in the current study
affirmed this value through positioning home as a site of belonging. As AOFY
described, home was a space they could envision, that they missed as they aged,
and that they associated with their childhood. These unique aspects serve to
further contextualize home as a site of belonging. Participants also made sense
of home as a constant and unwavering structure, and, at times, contrasted home
with experiences of inconsistency and instability in one’s family of origin and/or in
some foster placements. Further assessing what specific factors from AOFY’s past
experiences lead to an understanding of home as a site of consistency would be
a fruitful avenue for future research. Participants also discussed home as a physical
space in terms of shelter, as a place where needs such as sleeping, eating, and
storing clothes/belongings could occur. Home as a site of shelter appears to signify
a degree of detachment when compared to home as a site of belonging or
consistency. Because foster youth often transition from home to home while in
foster care (Reilly, 2002), it may be the case that stripping home of these functions
(i.e., belonging and consistency) serves a buffering effect in terms of expectations.
Future research ought to further explore the reasons why AOFY make sense of
home as a site of shelter.
Investigating Home Through Critical (Intersectional) Inquiry
Taken together, home as self and home as a place (where) complicate mainstream
understandings of family. Yet, cultural scholars such as bell hooks (2001, 2009) have
long illuminated the need for nuanced and intertwined understandings of home,
family, and love. Emergent and critical interrogations of home are especially imperative given, not only the difference that fostered youth experience regarding care and
placements but also the ethnic and SES trends seen within the US foster care system.
Just as Hooks (2001) points to those who have experienced unloving relationships as
needing to turn inward to find love, so too do fostered youth turn inward for a sense
of home.
Findings suggest one way that AOFY may experience home is through viewing
home as belonging to and manifesting inside of oneself. Thus, it is easy to suggest
that child welfare professionals support foster youth in identifying how they might
foster a sense of home inside of themselves, so these youth may never fully be
without home even in the direst of circumstances. In addition to fostering a sense of
home, practitioners and researchers alike must strive to employ the analytic lens of
intersectionality (see Collins & Bilge, 2016). For example, participants in the present
study are predominately female, emerging adults of color, and each of these identities (e.g., cultural positionings of women as kin keepers and men as breadwinners
within the home, power implications surrounding youth and maturity that might
impact one’s ability to attain a physical home space, and even issues of safety in
public spaces that vary across races/ethnicities and might lend to greater need for
Western Journal of Communication 189
spaces defined as safe) is uniquely enabled and constrained regarding expectations
and experiences of home, often resulting in a marginalized and/or underserved
status.
The present study provides a small step toward answering Collins’ (2019) call
to consider theorizing “from the perspective of people who are subordinated
within intersecting power relations” (p. 84). Future work should attend not only
to how formerly fostered youth make sense of home but also the ways in which
a) (intersectional) identities enable and constrain experiences and meanings of
home, and b) intersectional theorizing can promote critical interrogation of
possibilities and best practices to better (former) fostered youth’s lives.
Encouraging Conversations About Home
The desire for AOFY to be active in their home life decisions was made evident
in participants’ accounts. While AOFY demonstrates a desire for home, they want
to have a voice in the conversations that impact their home life experiences upon
transitioning out of care, resulting in a practical implication: child welfare
professionals ought to encourage conversations about home with youth who are
aging out of care.
As experiences of homelessness are common among AOFY (Courtney et al., 2016;
Fowler et al., 2009), understanding each individuals’ ideal home goals post-care could
be a fruitful venture for professionals who assist in creating individualized transition
plans for youth aging out of care. Current findings revealed that AOFY discursively
constructed home in myriad ways – as a place (where), as family, and as self. Arguably,
professionals working with AOFY could apply the knowledge gained from participants’
accounts to help youth who are currently aging out of the system identify a clear path to
their personal understanding of home. For example, for AOFY who define home as
a place where they can experience consistency, it would be fruitful for professionals to
assist AOFY in identifying and talking through places or spaces that may provide this
function. Indeed, home as a site of consistency may mean reconnecting and residing
with biological family members, residing in a transitional living facility, or finding an
apartment or house for AOFY to call their own. Thus, rather than making assumptions
about the home life that may best suit AOFY, it is important to talk through the
possibilities of home that might personally satisfy AOFY’s preferences. Ultimately,
talking about home plans early and often might illuminate systemic power structures
that enable and constrain experiences of home, as well as help AOFY better prepare for
the transition out of care.
Limitations and Future Directions
The current study relied on retrospective accounts from youth who aged out of
foster care within the past ten years; recruiting foster youth closer to the time they
age of care out might provide interesting insights into how AOFY communicate
190 L. R. Nelson and L. J. Thomas 
about and experience home life over time by allowing for longitudinal research
opportunities. Participants also made sense of home as a place by describing three
specific functions they ascribed to home: shelter, belonging, and consistency. While
each function offers a unique perspective on home as a place, all functions appear to
draw from AOFY’s home life experiences before, during, and/or after aging out of
care. Future research ought to explore whether individuals in other families marked
by many transitions – such as military and divorced families – similarly make sense
of home as a place.
Additionally, all interviews took place over the phone, which limits the sample to
individuals with phone access. Research has illustrated that the immediacy afforded
by face-to-face interviews allows for adaptability and responsiveness on the part of
the researcher which, in turn, might result in increased comfort on the part of the
participant to disclose (Lincoln & Guba, 1985); conversely, face-to-face interviews
might hinder openness, given participants’ anonymity is no longer guaranteed.
Looking forward, researchers might examine if face-to-face interviews alter
AOFY’s discursive constructions home.
Conclusion
The current study deepens understandings of how AOFY talk home into being.
AOFY’s complicated experiences of home before, during, and after aging out of care
shape their communication about what home means. Theoretical and practical
implications emerged from the findings in the current study, paving the way for
future research to explore how home life is discussed and experienced among AOFY
as well as other diverse family forms.
