  okay it is time for qualitative and
  mixed methods and this is going to be a
  lot because we're covering two things
  but um hopefully we'll be able to cover
  everything efficiently
  um this is obviously a big area and I'd
  certainly suggest that you look into
  taking other methods classes to learn
  even more about qualitative methods
  you can hit pause here if you want to
  take down some notes about what we're
  going to cover in this module
  
  so first we're going to talk about
  mixing methods
  um there are different types of mixing
  research one is called multi-methods
  approach which is using different types
  of methods within the same research
  tradition for example using multiple
  quantitative methods or multiple
  qualitative methods within a research
  project this isn't as big of a deal it
  happens pretty commonly including in
  qualitative research like you might do
  interviews and observation or you might
  do in quantitative research a survey
  before you do an experiment or you do a
  Content analysis before you do a survey
  mixed methods is specifically talking
  about research that involves both
  qualitative and quantitative research in
  the same project
  in a mixed methods project a researcher
  will collect and analyze both
  quantitative and qualitative data with
  very serious rigor
  in general people are doing this because
  they want to understand a question
  um both more broadly in terms of breadth
  and deeply in terms of death depth and
  corroborate their research usually the
  data is being mixed concurrently
  which at the same time sequentially
  which is in order or it's embedded one
  within the other and I'll talk more
  about this in a minute in general in
  mixed methods research there is
  generally a priority given to one or
  both forms of data it's it would be very
  difficult to have a mixed methods
  project that is truly equal between the
  two also in general researchers are
  trained in one tradition or the other
  and so certainly just like we talked
  about when we talked about paradigms and
  it being sort of like a religion if a
  researcher is trained qualitatively or
  quantitatively that tends to be the um
  type that they lean more towards even in
  a mixed methods project
  so when should you mix methods well
  sometimes one data source is
  insufficient to address your question
  another time it happens a lot is that
  there was an initial quantitative study
  and the results didn't make sense to the
  researcher or something happened that
  was weird so they say oh wow I need to
  go back and do some qualitative research
  to figure out what happened
  if exploratory findings need to be
  generalized so maybe there was a small
  qualitative study that was exploratory
  and then they want to do a larger survey
  study for example
  or maybe a secondary method is needed to
  enhance the primary method
  or a particular theoretical stance might
  need to be used
  or in a research project just demands
  that there be multiple projects involved
  to really address all the elements of it
  as I mentioned a minute ago you can mix
  in a lot of different ways the most
  common ways are sequentially or
  concurrently sequential designs are when
  one method comes before the other
  to the second method elaborates on the
  previous method but it's all within the
  same project concurrent designs is when
  they're happening simultaneously or
  concurrently I if I had to guess I'd say
  that probably sequential is more common
  than concurrent
  so in green 2007 some of the common
  purposes of using mixed method
  approaches that are discussed are first
  to discover New Perspectives or
  Frameworks especially if the findings
  contradict each other or they seem to
  create a paradox
  expanding the range of inquiry to be
  able to answer different aspects of a
  problem or an issue using different
  kinds of methods
  converge which is checking if the
  results across different methods
  correspond or coincide with one another
  maybe sometimes they don't
  complement which seeks to clarify or
  elaborate the results of one with
  another and develop to use the
  resultable method to build or inform the
  development of another method or another
  measure or somehow inform some
  methodological choices
  so some advantages of mixing methods is
  the primary one really is that there are
  weaknesses of any research method as
  you've learned and that mixing methods
  can allow to provide strengths that
  offset the weaknesses of quantitative
  and qualitative research on their own
  also it just provides more evidence for
  whatever you're trying to talk about
  it can sometimes help to answer
  questions that couldn't be answered by
  one approach alone
  um and you know and some nice things it
  can provide a bridge between
  quantitative and qualitative researchers
  there certainly is and especially in
  older generations of researchers a
  little bit of rivalry or disagreement
  between quantitative and qualitative
  researchers and so mixed methods can be
  a way for those different sides to meet
  and kind of all agree about what
  happened
  um also it can mean that multiple
  paradigms are used it allows the
  researcher to really use the best method
  for the question not what they are
  supposed to do
  also it's very practical because in real
  life people do tend to solve problems
  and answer questions with both numbers
  and words so it does make a lot of sense
  but also another huge advantage of
  mixing methods is that you can engage in
  triangulation and we've talked about
  triangulation before in this class
  it means that you're combining multiple
  approaches and perspectives usually
  within the same study to understand the
  same phenomenon
  um so we say okay I
  um
  want to figure out what the best taco in
  the U District is I'm gonna look it up
  on Yelp I'm gonna look at Google reviews
  I'm going to ask all my friends and I'm
  going to
  um
  have a survey that goes out on
  um you know so a group me for some
  people I know uh this would be
  triangulating that you're getting this
  information from different sources
  hopefully to come up with better results
  there are a couple different kinds of
  triangulation uh usually when we talk
  about triangulation we generally just
  mean data triangulation but there are
  different types data triangulation is it
  achieving is to achieved by gathering
  data across different time space
  populations
  Etc
  researcher triangulation involves the
  practice of having multiple researchers
  examining the same issue and this is
  especially important when we're looking
  at questions of social justice and in
  particular when
  some research team members might not be
  members of the community that is being
  studied
  theoretical triangulation is when a
  researcher examines the issue of
  interest from different theoretical
  perspectives to gain new insight
  and methodological triangulation is when
  we use multiple methods within a same
  project so this is a huge benefit
  because with the more perspectives
  you're getting you're going to get a
  better answer
  so some disadvantages of mixing methods
  is that as I mentioned a minute ago most
  researchers have training either in
  quantitative or qualitative research
  generally not both and so it can be very
  hard for researchers to mix methods when
  they really lived and breathed a
  particular method their entire research
  life and so this can be really
  challenging to also just switch mindsets
  and it's also hard to keep up on the
  latest and greatest if you're not
  actively doing that kind of research
  also getting some experience and mixed
  methods always helps to
  um be able to do them properly and so it
  could be very easy for someone to do
  them poorly if they don't have
  experience in mixing methods also it's
  going to take more time to collect and
  analyze both quantitative and
  qualitative data more resources to do
  the analysis of both sets of data it
  also can be really difficult to fit
  multiple method sections into one
  manuscript it takes up more space that
  you might want to use for your
  literature review or your results
  also it's possible that some people
  might look down on mixed methods
  um because they think that people should
  be purist so these are not major
  disadvantages but just things some
  things to note
  okay
  I am moving on now to talk about
  qualitative research
  what is qualitative research this is
  research that is not quantitative it
  doesn't have anything to do with numbers
  and instead it focuses on individual
  meaning
  qualitative research is far more
  interested in how and why than trying to
  establish cause and you may remember
  within quantitative research the goal is
  to establish cause that is the gold
  standard
  qualitative research uses open-ended
  questions and doesn't limit participants
  to like whereas in quantitative research
  you have these categories or numbers you
  have to answer
  qualitative research tries to collect
  data and the participants natural
  settings we describe it as naturalistic
  so for example we might want to observe
  if we're studying teachers we want to
  observe them in the classroom there's no
  like lab necessarily that people go to
  for qualitative research
  qualitative research almost exclusively
  uses an inductive approach so moving
  from specifics to generalized themes
  not generalizable but General
  the goal is to develop a rich
  understanding
  and in qualitative research the
  researcher is interpreting what people
  say or do
  in qualitative research we believe that
  by talking and watching people we can
  learn about their lived experiences and
  for some things
  the only way to get to that knowledge is
  through observing what people do
  um so if you know especially when people
  won't talk about it and so an example
  might be if you're trying to see how
  people flirt at a bar you're going to
  learn a lot more about it by watching
  them by actually then versus actually
  talking to people about it
  qualitative research is subjective
  because meetings are within individuals
  and we can only approximate meaning we
  cannot fully understand what people are
  experiencing we can just hope that we
  get at it the best we can
  in qualitative research
  sampling is usually purposeful or
  theoretical although sometimes there
  might be
  um qualitative research that uses
  convenient sampling but often it's based
  on a purpose
  and in qualitative research there's no
  Big Goal about generalizability we don't
  care if our study of these teenagers in
  Seattle
  would also apply to teenagers in Denver
  what we do hope for in qualitative
  research is that our findings are
  transferable that other researchers will
  find our research useful for them
  as I mentioned causality doesn't really
  matter and the written report is much
  more flexible in structure than the
  structure that you learned about with
  quantitative research where there's an
  introduction a literature review a
  method section Etc qualitative research
  is more flexible although I will say
  that within the field of communication
  it's pretty common in qualitative
  research for it to use the structure
  that you learned about with quantitative
  I would also say that doing qualitative
  research you really have to have a high
  tolerance for ambiguity because
  um you know unlike quantitative research
  where the people could be an answer and
  then you do the statistical analysis and
  that's that there's a lot more questions
  uh that you have to ask yourself in
  qualitative research so for some people
  this is really hard for them
  qualitative research requires people
  being really open and subjectively
  observing in qualitative research the
  researcher is the research instrument
  rather than the survey questionnaire
  um also we talked about reflexivity back
  when we talked about ethics but
  reflexivity is a really important part
  of qualitative research that the
  researcher has to be reflecting on how
  their personal traits characteristics
  position
  Etc
  their biases their viewpoints Etc shape
  all aspects of the research process
  and often within qualitative research
  there's a lot of reflection on the
  position of the researcher both as being
  an Insider and an outsider in the field
  setting so imagine you were observing a
  protest it's like are you there as a
  researcher are you there as a
  participant in the protest you're
  constantly asking yourself these
  questions
  a growing number of qualitative research
  studies ask for positionality statements
  which these are formal acknowledgments
  of the researcher's position like
  especially vis-a-vis the research
  participants so for example I have
  positionality statements that would say
  I'm a white CIS hetero woman who is not
  
  a member of the community that I am
  studying however I have studied this
  language for 25 years and I've lived in
  this country for this many years
  they are required but it is pretty
  
  typical to see them
  um not always but it's it's becoming
  more common and it's just this formal
  acknowledgment of what differences may
  exist and reviewers certainly will ask
  for them
  also in qualitative research there is
  this idea of an emic or ethic
  perspective
  um emik means Insider and ethic means
  Outsider I always try to remember that
  the m in emik is for me
  I don't know
  I I wish I had a better thing to uh
  remember it by because maybe that's
  confusing emmick is focused on utilizing
  the information that the participant
  supplies and it's very direct this is
  what that person said and like I am not
  as the researcher going to shape it at
  all attic is more focused on the
  researcher
  interpreting what the participants said
  um so the difference is very slight but
  in emik there's a stronger voice of the
  participant in the analysis
  
  so in terms of the actual process what's
  really interesting with qualitative data
  is that there's sort of everything's
  going on simultaneously there's a
  constant back and forth between
  collecting data
  um analyzing data identifying Concepts
  patterns and relationships drawing
  conclusions preparing data like you're
  always kind of going back and forth
  you might be in the middle of doing
  interviews and you start writing up your
  analysis and then you realize you have a
  new question and you go back and do more
  interviews so it's a lot more of a kind
  of Messier process I guess as a way to
  say it
  so research questions for hot
  qualitative research are a little
  different qualitative research would
  never use a hypothesis
  um or anything that's like a very
  objective statement there's usually
  broader research questions and then sub
  questions and they're very wide so for
  example This research proposes to
  examine drinking behaviors in social
  studies in amongst College age people
  and then you could have these sub
  questions of what are normative drinking
  behaviors how do some abstain from
  drinking how do they Define normative
  behaviors what's the problem that needs
  to be addressed let me give you a few
  examples of this so
  you could have a bigger question of
  should we teach sex ed in elementary
  schools
  we wouldn't usually use that for a
  qualitative research question because
  that should
  is pretty subjective right and so a
  research question related to this would
  be what are some differences in
  knowledge and attitudes of elementary
  school students who have been taught
  sexual education and those who have not
  like you could be interviewing
  elementary kids about what they know
  or here's another example what are the
  lyrics to the song Single Ladies by
  Beyonce reveal about modern female
  sexuality
  this is
  um really focused on the author's view
  oh sorry
  focused on the author's View and
  um not how it's understood by audiences
  so a revised research question for a
  qualitative study would be how do high
  school girls interpret this song
  so data and qualitative research uses
  emergent design principles where the
  study can and almost always does change
  as the research process unfolds like
  that chart that I showed you like it's
  always just ongoing and changing all the
  time so you might be adding new
  interview questions because you learn
  something in the first three weeks of
  interviewing for example
  um the data in a qualitative research
  study is going to be a thick description
  this means that there's a close reading
  and detailed very thorough description
  of the experiences
  including specific contextualized
  information that's going to help the
  reader understand what's going on
  in qualitative research you are keeping
  lots and lots and lots of data you have
  so many records that you're keeping
  because you're really trying to preserve
  the situated character of what you com
  of what you observed as best you can so
  in qualitative research we take very
  descriptive field notes that describe
  and interpret the scene from like what
  the weather was like to what people were
  wearing to if there were any spells like
  everything you record in these notes
  your personal and emotional reactions
  and the sequence of events that took
  place
  um these also sometimes can be called
  field jottings that might be quick notes
  that people take
  um whereas the field notes might be
  more developed after the fact like the
  fields audience would be on the scene
  the field notes you might go home at the
  end of the day and kind of finish out
  what you're writing
  analytic memos are analyzes that come to
  mind while you're going through your
  notes
  so you might do a couple interviews in
  the day and then you go home at the end
  of the day and you go through all your
  notes and you're like oh I really see
  this pattern about this thing so you're
  taking these memos kind of in the
  margins about what you are interpreting
  while you're doing it
  um and then the data are going to be
  analyzed that I'm going to talk about
  next but data collection is not done
  until you reach saturation and
  saturation means that no new
  observations are bringing any sort of
  new insights to you that you're feeling
  like wow I've done 35 interviews I feel
  like I'm sort of hearing the same thing
  over and over again and so at that point
  you kind of say to yourself all right
  I'm gonna do five more just in case and
  if I still feel like I've reached
  saturation I'm going to finish so
  frequently in qualitative studies
  there's not sort of a planned number of
  people that must be interviewed or must
  be observed
  in the data analysis you first have to
  transform your data into readable text
  so if you did audio interviews and you
  recorded them you have to type them up
  or pay someone to type them up
  if you went to an event and you took
  pictures you need to write up
  descriptions of the papers or the
  pictures so you have to have it in
  readable text and then you have to check
  and make sure that there aren't any
  errors and so um if there's multiple
  people on the team they might check you
  know each other's notes you always have
  to compare the transcription of your
  interview with the actual audio
  recordings there are always mistakes I
  will say now with zoom it is a little
  bit better but there are always some
  mistakes
  and then you start thinking about how
  you're going to manage the data you
  might organize them by attribute coding
  like coding characteristics of the
  participants or the setting or the other
  phenomenon like you're like okay I'm
  gonna organize these by male
  participants and female participants and
  non-binary participants or by Bosses and
  workers whatever there must be some way
  you have to organize them and then
  you're going to be storing your data in
  a physical or electronic filing system
  nowadays there are a ton of different
  software programs that people use to
  manage these data some of them are in
  the book chapter you can read about them
  but basically the bigger your project
  the more you need to have one of these
  data management systems because it can
  be a lot and especially if you have
  audio video pictures Etc the more
  complicated and more types of media you
  have the more you need a system
  so in this you are drawing conclusions
  that you're hoping are going to be rich
  description identification of themes
  making inferences about patterns and
  Concepts that you're seeing and
  potentially some theoretical
  propositions like ideas about how things
  work
  so it's important that we talk about
  validity
  um validity Works quite a bit
  differently in qualitative research than
  it does in quantitative external
  validity AKA generalizability isn't a
  big concern in qualitative research as
  we already noted transferability is are
  my findings
  useful to other people
  we also care a lot about that the
  findings
  are honest and trustworthy that is what
  validity means in qualitative research
  so there are a couple types of validity
  that we talk about often in qualitative
  research and the first is descriptive
  validity possibly one of the more
  important ones and this is that the
  researcher did not embellish or distort
  the information and that what is
  reported is really what happened
  interpretive validity is that the
  researchers sensitivity and mental
  processes to capture and interpret the
  meanings of what happened is in fact
  legitimate as to what happened
  theoretical validity is perhaps the most
  important some would say and this is how
  much a theoretical explanation that's
  developed through the analysis is
  consistent with the data it can't just
  come from nowhere
  as I mentioned transferability that the
  explanation could apply to other
  situations or populations it could be
  useful to others and then valuation
  validity is the ability to look
  critically at the results
  and the research itself as a way of
  learning and expanding one's
  understanding
  
  so
  how do we do this well we
  compare notes in collaborative research
  we look at trying to do triangulation
  
  we also often will examine exceptions to
  patterns in the data and a version of
  this is negative case analysis cases
  when there was a major deviation from
  other data if a negative case can be
  explained it strengthens the explanation
  of the typical case
  so how this sort of works is that you
  look at data that doesn't fit in okay
  and let's say for example that you were
  studying people who have chronic
  illnesses and how they cope with their
  chronic illnesses you're doing a bunch
  of interviews and you have common themes
  that people say oh you know I have a
  good attitude I have the support and
  loved ones Etc and then you have a
  participant who doesn't say these things
  you've heard a million times that they
  you know rely on their loved ones and
  that they have a good attitude or
  whatever
  and this person is like I actually don't
  feel supported and I have a bad attitude
  about my chronic
  Le this case challenges those themes
  that you've seen emerge and this
  requires you as the researcher to ask
  yourself all right I interviewed Judy
  why was her experience so different than
  everyone else and so you might interview
  Judy a second time to ask more questions
  or you might try to look deeper in the
  data to see if other people had more
  experiences similar to Judy and so by
  thinking about this with the more
  nuanced understanding of her is the
  exception it helps you better understand
  what the major problems are so that's a
  negative case analysis
  another form of validity
  evaluation and qualitative research is
  member checking and that is asking
  participants directly
  if the data that you've found and your
  findings make sense to them maybe you
  don't talk to your participants directly
  you could ask people who are members of
  that community that might be more
  accessible to you versus your original
  participants but either way you check
  with them like does this make sense what
  I found
  so some strengths of qualitative
  research that naturalistic approach
  allowing people to be in their natural
  settings and for people to answer
  questions in their own words means that
  this is very valid because the truth is
  much more embedded within your data of
  what the experiences of those people are
  it also is a subjective and
  contextualized understanding it studies
  people in their own environment with
  their own view of their own worlds
  the flexible research designs really
  great it lends itself to being able to
  study Dynamic situations especially if
  things change that you can change your
  research in a minute to ask different
  questions
  um also as you find out more things you
  can change your project my a classic
  example of this is I went to go do a
  study a number of years ago that I
  really thought that um I was going to be
  studying one thing and I did about three
  weeks of interviews and I realized that
  some of my assumptions were totally
  wrong and I ended up changing my whole
  project in the middle of it because the
  people were telling me something else
  that was much more interesting and I
  ended up doing a bunch of really cool
  interviews about it but thankfully I
  wasn't doing a survey that I couldn't
  have changed it as easily
  some drawbacks of qualitative research
  it's not very efficient it takes a ton
  of time and there is so much data to
  manage people that do quantitative
  research get it done way faster
  qualitative research can take weeks
  months years it's really hard also the
  subjectivity is a concern
  um
  it could be criticized by some as being
  too subjective
  some people don't value qualitative
  research as much because it's subjective
  and I'm sure probably some of you
  um and initially reading some of this
  stuff about qualitative research you're
  like how is this legitimate
  um some quantitative researchers look
  down on qualitative research but I think
  that that's changing qualitative
  research absolutely matters and it's
  getting things that quantitative
  research never could
  so we're going to talk about four types
  of qualitative research I've already
  mentioned interviews quite a bit
  um because it's one that most people are
  familiar with and then we're going to
  talk about a couple other ones really
  briefly
  um so let's first start with ethnography
  ethnography is the description of a
  people and the cultural basis of their
  peoplehood if you've ever seen on
  Discovery Channel or National Geographic
  sort of these shows were like some old
  white dude with a beard goes and lives
  with a tribe for a year and tries to
  learn their ways that is sort of the
  scaffolding on which ethnography was
  based upon with from anthropology
  today it is more complex than that and
  there are a lot of problems with that
  old model of ethnography but that is the
  the tradition
  um we try to study an intact cultural
  group in a natural setting over a period
  of time through observing them
  um we might directly observe them by
  taking notes sometimes people do some
  recordings depends
  in ethnography we believe that some
  things in life can only be observed but
  you have to watch for a really long time
  to get a lot of data points because what
  if that one week You observe that group
  was somehow really exceptional it was
  the week of a holiday or something weird
  happened you gotta watch for a really
  long time
  you have these detailed notes lots of
  data and the goal again is thick
  description
  with a goal of sad you know you're done
  when you've achieved saturation
  ethnography requires you to be really
  flexible but a big downside is that it's
  very difficult to replicate and there
  was a case in the late 80s early 90s
  that this guy who was a linguist you
  know white guy with a beard went and
  lived with this tribe and he made this
  argument about how the tribe's language
  structure like basically that they had
  no past tense in their language
  um but
  you know and then he made a big career
  on this and later like I don't know 20
  years later or something people went
  they were like actually that's not true
  at all so
  you really have to trust that what
  people say is in fact what really
  happened
  um obviously these sort of things don't
  happen that frequently but
  um it is it is a big drawback
  So within ethnography there's different
  ways that we think about the position of
  the actual person doing the research so
  participant observation is a method in
  which a researcher is both an observer
  of and a participant in the culture they
  are examining so this is very
  naturalistic but people need to be aware
  of their Insider Outsider status
  so
  um
  within this there are kind of different
  variations so let's talk about some of
  these differences so one is complete
  participant
  this is when a researcher is definitely
  a member of the group they're studying
  and they are concealing their member
  role so that they will not disrupt the
  natural activity of the group so for
  example imagine that someone is a member
  of a particular religion or a particular
  Club
  they would not disclose this information
  so that
  um no one acts differently
  now participant as Observer is when
  people know that the researcher is an
  observer
  but
  it is less important than their role as
  a group member so for example I have
  this friend sunny and she studies
  korean-american churches she herself is
  korean-american she herself is a
  churchgoer but she also researches this
  group
  when she goes to church
  she is doing research but everyone
  sitting around her isn't thinking about
  Sunny doing research they're thinking
  about Sunny who is korean-american
  is a member of their Church her role as
  a member of that group is more important
  to everybody involved than the fact that
  she's a researcher whereas I a white
  woman who's not a member of that church
  Community if I went in there probably
  people would notice and be like what's
  going on
  so
  um the advantage for people like Sunny
  is she is getting a lot of depth of
  knowledge but it is less confidential
  like if she writes a study up about this
  church like her church members know that
  their dog that she's talking about their
  Church
  um observers participant this is when
  the researchers Observer activities are
  known to the group
  but the research researchers
  participation in the group is very
  secondary to their observation work
  so
  this could be an example of someone
  that's like doing like a teacher
  observation they're not like actively a
  member of the class but they're kind of
  hanging out
  uh in the back I mean they're still
  physically there people notice them but
  they're the fact that they're a
  researcher is primary
  complete Observer is when someone tries
  to remain unobtrusive and does not
  engage with people at all
  and there are different ways to do this
  and one way is a covert Observer
  they are observing and they're publicly
  identified a covert participant is when
  someone's fully immersed in the setting
  without revealing their research
  identity
  so all of these are kind of these
  different ways of thinking thinking
  about these um
  obviously these are not solid categories
  like maybe some people know that Sunny
  is a researcher and other people don't
  Etc but in all of these settings it's
  just thinking about at any time who am I
  in this moment am I an Insider or an
  outsider
  so if you do participate in observation
  which I would totally suggest you do it
  can be really interesting like you can
  go to a park and see how parents and
  kids are playing on the playground or
  whatever
  um you first in your notes you kind of
  set the scene you describe things how
  they are like who's in the park what's
  the noise level what's the weather like
  what's going on
  and then you start identifying actions
  how are people behaving you kind of
  start noticing things about like what's
  going on
  you then identify the actors you're like
  there's this guy here I think he's the
  dad to the kid with the red hat
  um how are people interacting with the
  scene
  you know dad with the kid the kid with
  the red hat is pushing the kid down the
  slide
  where and when do actors interact and
  what events are significant and you're
  just taking notes on all of this
  so where are you doing this well gaining
  access to doing ethnographic observation
  can be really difficult public settings
  like a park as I just mentioned are open
  to everyone you don't have to get
  permission from the people involved
  um you might tell the authorities I
  don't know
  like if there's Park police or something
  you might tell them this is called
  Gatekeepers
  semi-public settings like a store or a
  restaurant or a bar usually demand that
  a person actually do something
  um about the fact that they're there
  observing because people might be
  suspicious if you're just sitting there
  taking notes so you probably should tell
  the owner or the manager what you're
  doing
  and then a private setting like
  someone's home or a private club
  this is not okay for you just to go and
  observe in you have to get formal
  permission and it can be really
  difficult to access so studies that are
  on like a workplace environment and
  stuff are really special because someone
  got access
  there's also unobtrusive observation we
  prefer the people don't know that
  they're being watched they won't change
  their behaviors and there are some other
  ways that you can do this like a
  behavioral Trace study looking at
  artifacts to help you understand
  people's behavior
  um I did this once that we dumped we we
  turned over the trash dumpsters and
  recycling dumpsters at a school to
  understand what the kids were and
  weren't recycling so that's a behavioral
  Trace study
  also disguise field observations that
  you might um
  they know that you're there but they
  don't know what you're doing so if
  you're at that Park taking notes maybe
  they just think you're writing a poem
  so the next type is interview this
  you're probably familiar with already
  it's a process where a researcher a
  participant are engaging in a
  conversation focused on particular
  questions related to a research study
  you can think of it as a conversation
  with a purpose
  what is the purpose to seek to describe
  the meaning that people have experienced
  and make reference to people's
  experiences and their perspectives
  through stories and accounts and
  explanations
  you can get at what people's attitudes
  and beliefs opinions and experiences are
  you can understand the way that they
  describe things in their words
  you can also gather information about
  things that cannot be observed you can
  say you know I saw you do that thing
  over there why did you do that and you
  can also ask about the past
  no I will say interviews are much harder
  than they seem
  and really the best way to do an
  interview is to develop rapport
  you show respect and you agree on the
  rules of the interaction be kind
  um because this will make people feel
  much more comfortable
  interviews are often audio or videotaped
  for transcription but sometimes someone
  might not want it to be audio or
  videotaped so you just have to take good
  notes
  interviews always start with an
  explanation of what your study is and
  getting informed consent questions can
  be asked in various orders I'll show you
  a couple examples in a minute as I said
  they're usually recorded but usually you
  take notes at the same time
  the transcriptions will often be
  analyzed with this particular software
  and researchers will work inductively
  identifying various patterns and themes
  and the goal is to have an analysis that
  has Rich description and theoretical
  conclusions
  there are three main ways that
  interviews are structured first is
  highly structured which the wording of
  the question is predetermined the order
  is predetermined and you ask people the
  same way in the same order every time
  and an example of this are government
  censuses they're like everybody needs to
  be asked what's your job what's your age
  how many people live in this house
  semi-structured is very common and it's
  a mix of more and less structured
  questions everything's flexible and you
  have broader questions with probes that
  are follow-up for more detail there
  might be some questions you ask
  everybody
  um but maybe interviews going in a
  different direction so you end up kind
  of talking about different things
  an unstructured interview is the most
  flexible it's more like a conversation
  we tend only use this when a researcher
  knows almost nothing about a topic
  um why does it keep on going like that
  and uh
  the goal is to learn and this also makes
  people feel really comfortable sometimes
  it can be scary for people when um
  they have you know this list of
  questions in front of them
  so
  the interview guide is a list of topics
  and if you have a semi-structured
  interview specific questions and if you
  have a structured interview all the
  questions and includes the main
  questions and probes so those main
  questions are directly related to your
  research question and the probes are
  things to clarify follow-up Etc
  and oftentimes an interview guide will
  start with a grand tour question then
  ask for a general description of what's
  going on my grand tour question when I
  do studies about people's technology use
  is I'll ask them to tell me about like
  the first social media site they ever
  used and kind of tell me the story of
  that and that works really well because
  I can ask them to reflect upon their
  current use like I'll say oh you know
  you told me when you were a kid and you
  were on whatever site
  um that most of your friends were from
  school can you tell me sort of who
  you're friends with on on these sites
  now and so that allows for a comparison
  
  so our next type is focus group focus
  group is highly related to interview
  except there's multiple people these are
  small group discussions led by a
  moderator usually six to twelve people I
  think six to nine is best I think 12 is
  too many in my opinion usually people
  are seated around a table
  they are selected for a particular
  characteristic and then there's a
  moderator who asks questions and guides
  the discussion
  sometimes there's a mix of people
  sometimes not it depends on the goal
  um usually no more than an hour and you
  really have to have a good moderator
  usually these are video recorded but
  sometimes the researcher is watching
  through a video camera or a two-way
  mirror and might be um sending questions
  into the ear of the moderator possibly
  there's a couple different videos of
  focus groups that I want you to watch
  they're in the syllabus and on canvas
  just to give you a sense of how these
  work and I think that this will be
  helpful for you to kind of see how they
  are
  um a little difficult to manage
  so why would you do a focus group not an
  individual interview well you get more
  people at one time
  and people cue each other so it sort of
  simulates real life if you're asking
  people what's your opinion about a
  particular politician having them all
  cure each other's opinions it kind of uh
  gives you a different kind of data than
  if you're just one-on-one with somebody
  why would you do them well if you need
  information really fast or you're doing
  exploratory research or you're trying to
  get new ideas also if slang matters and
  the way people talk about things
  if participants are easily distracted
  like kids it's easier to do a focus
  group than one-on-one interviews
  um or if it's a special population
  that's hard to access
  um also if you just want to kind of take
  the temperature like how are people
  feeling about this thing and you'll see
  this in the example videos
  so some drawbacks to a focus group
  they can be very difficult to manage
  especially if they're large and there
  can be a cascading effect where maybe
  one or two people have an opinion and
  that opinion becomes so dominant that
  you don't really get to know the other
  opinions
  you also can't really use the focus
  group data to make any assessments about
  what individuals feel it's really about
  what the group said
  and also the group composition can
  matter if there's power or cultural
  differences in the group it can impact
  the study
  focus group questions go in a funnel
  structure that you start out with the
  broad topics and then you funnel down to
  more focused and specific issues and
  then you kind of finish out with
  confirming and validating the main
  points like you would say so you know
  you said such and such can't is that
  really how you feel
  so that's how focus group runs see those
  videos to get a sense of how they really
  work they are pretty wild
  um I am not a big fan I find them to be
  really difficult to manage but maybe
  other people have better experiences
  than me
  so textual analysis
  um this is really just an umbrella term
  that encompasses a ton of types of
  qualitative approaches take a
  qualitative methods class if you want to
  learn more about these but they include
  narrative analysis discourse analysis
  thematic analysis rhetorical criticism
  archival analysis performance studies
  Etc and this is when you are analyzing
  non-living data like social media posts
  news articles TV shows pictures clothes
  whatever and you're focusing on
  categorizing and enumerating and
  establishing relationships amongst the
  among the patterns and that you see in
  the text
  sometimes
  um you're also asking questions about
  how these texts are specifically being
  used in different cultural environments
  so this is very similar to content
  analysis but it's less focused on
  Counting and more about just looking at
  what is inside of this text
  grounded their theory is an inductive
  approach to qualitative data analysis
  that's often used with textual analysis
  that the goal is to discover patterns
  through constant comparisons you're
  comparing each new observation to things
  you've already observed
  interestingly it does not use prior
  literature or Theory to guide your
  coding at all it is all a blank slate
  um people say that they want to use this
  but it's really hard it's always easier
  to have
  um prior literature helping to guide you
  also with textual analysis or grounded
  Theory analysis using this software to
  help you manage your data makes life
  infinitely easier
  okay it is time for qualitative and
  mixed methods and this is going to be a
  lot because we're covering two things
  but um hopefully we'll be able to cover
  everything efficiently
  um this is obviously a big area and I'd
  certainly suggest that you look into
  taking other methods classes to learn
  even more about qualitative methods
  you can hit pause here if you want to
  take down some notes about what we're
  going to cover in this module
  
  so first we're going to talk about
  mixing methods
  um there are different types of mixing
  research one is called multi-methods
  approach which is using different types
  of methods within the same research
  tradition for example using multiple
  quantitative methods or multiple
  qualitative methods within a research
  project this isn't as big of a deal it
  happens pretty commonly including in
  qualitative research like you might do
  interviews and observation or you might
  do in quantitative research a survey
  before you do an experiment or you do a
  Content analysis before you do a survey
  mixed methods is specifically talking
  about research that involves both
  qualitative and quantitative research in
  the same project
  in a mixed methods project a researcher
  will collect and analyze both
  quantitative and qualitative data with
  very serious rigor
  in general people are doing this because
  they want to understand a question
  um both more broadly in terms of breadth
  and deeply in terms of death depth and
  corroborate their research usually the
  data is being mixed concurrently
  which at the same time sequentially
  which is in order or it's embedded one
  within the other and I'll talk more
  about this in a minute in general in
  mixed methods research there is
  generally a priority given to one or
  both forms of data it's it would be very
  difficult to have a mixed methods
  project that is truly equal between the
  two also in general researchers are
  trained in one tradition or the other
  and so certainly just like we talked
  about when we talked about paradigms and
  it being sort of like a religion if a
  researcher is trained qualitatively or
  quantitatively that tends to be the um
  type that they lean more towards even in
  a mixed methods project
  so when should you mix methods well
  sometimes one data source is
  insufficient to address your question
  another time it happens a lot is that
  there was an initial quantitative study
  and the results didn't make sense to the
  researcher or something happened that
  was weird so they say oh wow I need to
  go back and do some qualitative research
  to figure out what happened
  if exploratory findings need to be
  generalized so maybe there was a small
  qualitative study that was exploratory
  and then they want to do a larger survey
  study for example
  or maybe a secondary method is needed to
  enhance the primary method
  or a particular theoretical stance might
  need to be used
  or in a research project just demands
  that there be multiple projects involved
  to really address all the elements of it
  as I mentioned a minute ago you can mix
  in a lot of different ways the most
  common ways are sequentially or
  concurrently sequential designs are when
  one method comes before the other
  to the second method elaborates on the
  previous method but it's all within the
  same project concurrent designs is when
  they're happening simultaneously or
  concurrently I if I had to guess I'd say
  that probably sequential is more common
  than concurrent
  so in green 2007 some of the common
  purposes of using mixed method
  approaches that are discussed are first
  to discover New Perspectives or
  Frameworks especially if the findings
  contradict each other or they seem to
  create a paradox
  expanding the range of inquiry to be
  able to answer different aspects of a
  problem or an issue using different
  kinds of methods
  converge which is checking if the
  results across different methods
  correspond or coincide with one another
  maybe sometimes they don't
  complement which seeks to clarify or
  elaborate the results of one with
  another and develop to use the
  resultable method to build or inform the
  development of another method or another
  measure or somehow inform some
  methodological choices
  so some advantages of mixing methods is
  the primary one really is that there are
  weaknesses of any research method as
  you've learned and that mixing methods
  can allow to provide strengths that
  offset the weaknesses of quantitative
  and qualitative research on their own
  also it just provides more evidence for
  whatever you're trying to talk about
  it can sometimes help to answer
  questions that couldn't be answered by
  one approach alone
  um and you know and some nice things it
  can provide a bridge between
  quantitative and qualitative researchers
  there certainly is and especially in
  older generations of researchers a
  little bit of rivalry or disagreement
  between quantitative and qualitative
  researchers and so mixed methods can be
  a way for those different sides to meet
  and kind of all agree about what
  happened
  um also it can mean that multiple
  paradigms are used it allows the
  researcher to really use the best method
  for the question not what they are
  supposed to do
  also it's very practical because in real
  life people do tend to solve problems
  and answer questions with both numbers
  and words so it does make a lot of sense
  but also another huge advantage of
  mixing methods is that you can engage in
  triangulation and we've talked about
  triangulation before in this class
  it means that you're combining multiple
  approaches and perspectives usually
  within the same study to understand the
  same phenomenon
  um so we say okay I
  um
  want to figure out what the best taco in
  the U District is I'm gonna look it up
  on Yelp I'm gonna look at Google reviews
  I'm going to ask all my friends and I'm
  going to
  um
  have a survey that goes out on
  um you know so a group me for some
  people I know uh this would be
  triangulating that you're getting this
  information from different sources
  hopefully to come up with better results
  there are a couple different kinds of
  triangulation uh usually when we talk
  about triangulation we generally just
  mean data triangulation but there are
  different types data triangulation is it
  achieving is to achieved by gathering
  data across different time space
  populations
  Etc
  researcher triangulation involves the
  practice of having multiple researchers
  examining the same issue and this is
  especially important when we're looking
  at questions of social justice and in
  particular when
  some research team members might not be
  members of the community that is being
  studied
  theoretical triangulation is when a
  researcher examines the issue of
  interest from different theoretical
  perspectives to gain new insight
  and methodological triangulation is when
  we use multiple methods within a same
  project so this is a huge benefit
  because with the more perspectives
  you're getting you're going to get a
  better answer
  so some disadvantages of mixing methods
  is that as I mentioned a minute ago most
  researchers have training either in
  quantitative or qualitative research
  generally not both and so it can be very
  hard for researchers to mix methods when
  they really lived and breathed a
  particular method their entire research
  life and so this can be really
  challenging to also just switch mindsets
  and it's also hard to keep up on the
  latest and greatest if you're not
  actively doing that kind of research
  also getting some experience and mixed
  methods always helps to
  um be able to do them properly and so it
  could be very easy for someone to do
  them poorly if they don't have
  experience in mixing methods also it's
  going to take more time to collect and
  analyze both quantitative and
  qualitative data more resources to do
  the analysis of both sets of data it
  also can be really difficult to fit
  multiple method sections into one
  manuscript it takes up more space that
  you might want to use for your
  literature review or your results
  also it's possible that some people
  might look down on mixed methods
  um because they think that people should
  be purist so these are not major
  disadvantages but just things some
  things to note
  okay
  I am moving on now to talk about
  qualitative research
  what is qualitative research this is
  research that is not quantitative it
  doesn't have anything to do with numbers
  and instead it focuses on individual
  meaning
  qualitative research is far more
  interested in how and why than trying to
  establish cause and you may remember
  within quantitative research the goal is
  to establish cause that is the gold
  standard
  qualitative research uses open-ended
  questions and doesn't limit participants
  to like whereas in quantitative research
  you have these categories or numbers you
  have to answer
  qualitative research tries to collect
  data and the participants natural
  settings we describe it as naturalistic
  so for example we might want to observe
  if we're studying teachers we want to
  observe them in the classroom there's no
  like lab necessarily that people go to
  for qualitative research
  qualitative research almost exclusively
  uses an inductive approach so moving
  from specifics to generalized themes
  not generalizable but General
  the goal is to develop a rich
  understanding
  and in qualitative research the
  researcher is interpreting what people
  say or do
  in qualitative research we believe that
  by talking and watching people we can
  learn about their lived experiences and
  for some things
  the only way to get to that knowledge is
  through observing what people do
  um so if you know especially when people
  won't talk about it and so an example
  might be if you're trying to see how
  people flirt at a bar you're going to
  learn a lot more about it by watching
  them by actually then versus actually
  talking to people about it
  qualitative research is subjective
  because meetings are within individuals
  and we can only approximate meaning we
  cannot fully understand what people are
  experiencing we can just hope that we
  get at it the best we can
  in qualitative research
  sampling is usually purposeful or
  theoretical although sometimes there
  might be
  um qualitative research that uses
  convenient sampling but often it's based
  on a purpose
  and in qualitative research there's no
  Big Goal about generalizability we don't
  care if our study of these teenagers in
  Seattle
  would also apply to teenagers in Denver
  what we do hope for in qualitative
  research is that our findings are
  transferable that other researchers will
  find our research useful for them
  as I mentioned causality doesn't really
  matter and the written report is much
  more flexible in structure than the
  structure that you learned about with
  quantitative research where there's an
  introduction a literature review a
  method section Etc qualitative research
  is more flexible although I will say
  that within the field of communication
  it's pretty common in qualitative
  research for it to use the structure
  that you learned about with quantitative
  I would also say that doing qualitative
  research you really have to have a high
  tolerance for ambiguity because
  um you know unlike quantitative research
  where the people could be an answer and
  then you do the statistical analysis and
  that's that there's a lot more questions
  uh that you have to ask yourself in
  qualitative research so for some people
  this is really hard for them
  qualitative research requires people
  being really open and subjectively
  observing in qualitative research the
  researcher is the research instrument
  rather than the survey questionnaire
  um also we talked about reflexivity back
  when we talked about ethics but
  reflexivity is a really important part
  of qualitative research that the
  researcher has to be reflecting on how
  their personal traits characteristics
  position
  Etc
  their biases their viewpoints Etc shape
  all aspects of the research process
  and often within qualitative research
  there's a lot of reflection on the
  position of the researcher both as being
  an Insider and an outsider in the field
  setting so imagine you were observing a
  protest it's like are you there as a
  researcher are you there as a
  participant in the protest you're
  constantly asking yourself these
  questions
  a growing number of qualitative research
  studies ask for positionality statements
  which these are formal acknowledgments
  of the researcher's position like
  especially vis-a-vis the research
  participants so for example I have
  positionality statements that would say
  I'm a white CIS hetero woman who is not
  
  a member of the community that I am
  studying however I have studied this
  language for 25 years and I've lived in
  this country for this many years
  they are required but it is pretty
  
  typical to see them
  um not always but it's it's becoming
  more common and it's just this formal
  acknowledgment of what differences may
  exist and reviewers certainly will ask
  for them
  also in qualitative research there is
  this idea of an emic or ethic
  perspective
  um emik means Insider and ethic means
  Outsider I always try to remember that
  the m in emik is for me
  I don't know
  I I wish I had a better thing to uh
  remember it by because maybe that's
  confusing emmick is focused on utilizing
  the information that the participant
  supplies and it's very direct this is
  what that person said and like I am not
  as the researcher going to shape it at
  all attic is more focused on the
  researcher
  interpreting what the participants said
  um so the difference is very slight but
  in emik there's a stronger voice of the
  participant in the analysis
  
  so in terms of the actual process what's
  really interesting with qualitative data
  is that there's sort of everything's
  going on simultaneously there's a
  constant back and forth between
  collecting data
  um analyzing data identifying Concepts
  patterns and relationships drawing
  conclusions preparing data like you're
  always kind of going back and forth
  you might be in the middle of doing
  interviews and you start writing up your
  analysis and then you realize you have a
  new question and you go back and do more
  interviews so it's a lot more of a kind
  of Messier process I guess as a way to
  say it
  so research questions for hot
  qualitative research are a little
  different qualitative research would
  never use a hypothesis
  um or anything that's like a very
  objective statement there's usually
  broader research questions and then sub
  questions and they're very wide so for
  example This research proposes to
  examine drinking behaviors in social
  studies in amongst College age people
  and then you could have these sub
  questions of what are normative drinking
  behaviors how do some abstain from
  drinking how do they Define normative
  behaviors what's the problem that needs
  to be addressed let me give you a few
  examples of this so
  you could have a bigger question of
  should we teach sex ed in elementary
  schools
  we wouldn't usually use that for a
  qualitative research question because
  that should
  is pretty subjective right and so a
  research question related to this would
  be what are some differences in
  knowledge and attitudes of elementary
  school students who have been taught
  sexual education and those who have not
  like you could be interviewing
  elementary kids about what they know
  or here's another example what are the
  lyrics to the song Single Ladies by
  Beyonce reveal about modern female
  sexuality
  this is
  um really focused on the author's view
  oh sorry
  focused on the author's View and
  um not how it's understood by audiences
  so a revised research question for a
  qualitative study would be how do high
  school girls interpret this song
  so data and qualitative research uses
  emergent design principles where the
  study can and almost always does change
  as the research process unfolds like
  that chart that I showed you like it's
  always just ongoing and changing all the
  time so you might be adding new
  interview questions because you learn
  something in the first three weeks of
  interviewing for example
  um the data in a qualitative research
  study is going to be a thick description
  this means that there's a close reading
  and detailed very thorough description
  of the experiences
  including specific contextualized
  information that's going to help the
  reader understand what's going on
  in qualitative research you are keeping
  lots and lots and lots of data you have
  so many records that you're keeping
  because you're really trying to preserve
  the situated character of what you com
  of what you observed as best you can so
  in qualitative research we take very
  descriptive field notes that describe
  and interpret the scene from like what
  the weather was like to what people were
  wearing to if there were any spells like
  everything you record in these notes
  your personal and emotional reactions
  and the sequence of events that took
  place
  um these also sometimes can be called
  field jottings that might be quick notes
  that people take
  um whereas the field notes might be
  more developed after the fact like the
  fields audience would be on the scene
  the field notes you might go home at the
  end of the day and kind of finish out
  what you're writing
  analytic memos are analyzes that come to
  mind while you're going through your
  notes
  so you might do a couple interviews in
  the day and then you go home at the end
  of the day and you go through all your
  notes and you're like oh I really see
  this pattern about this thing so you're
  taking these memos kind of in the
  margins about what you are interpreting
  while you're doing it
  um and then the data are going to be
  analyzed that I'm going to talk about
  next but data collection is not done
  until you reach saturation and
  saturation means that no new
  observations are bringing any sort of
  new insights to you that you're feeling
  like wow I've done 35 interviews I feel
  like I'm sort of hearing the same thing
  over and over again and so at that point
  you kind of say to yourself all right
  I'm gonna do five more just in case and
  if I still feel like I've reached
  saturation I'm going to finish so
  frequently in qualitative studies
  there's not sort of a planned number of
  people that must be interviewed or must
  be observed
  in the data analysis you first have to
  transform your data into readable text
  so if you did audio interviews and you
  recorded them you have to type them up
  or pay someone to type them up
  if you went to an event and you took
  pictures you need to write up
  descriptions of the papers or the
  pictures so you have to have it in
  readable text and then you have to check
  and make sure that there aren't any
  errors and so um if there's multiple
  people on the team they might check you
  know each other's notes you always have
  to compare the transcription of your
  interview with the actual audio
  recordings there are always mistakes I
  will say now with zoom it is a little
  bit better but there are always some
  mistakes
  and then you start thinking about how
  you're going to manage the data you
  might organize them by attribute coding
  like coding characteristics of the
  participants or the setting or the other
  phenomenon like you're like okay I'm
  gonna organize these by male
  participants and female participants and
  non-binary participants or by Bosses and
  workers whatever there must be some way
  you have to organize them and then
  you're going to be storing your data in
  a physical or electronic filing system
  nowadays there are a ton of different
  software programs that people use to
  manage these data some of them are in
  the book chapter you can read about them
  but basically the bigger your project
  the more you need to have one of these
  data management systems because it can
  be a lot and especially if you have
  audio video pictures Etc the more
  complicated and more types of media you
  have the more you need a system
  so in this you are drawing conclusions
  that you're hoping are going to be rich
  description identification of themes
  making inferences about patterns and
  Concepts that you're seeing and
  potentially some theoretical
  propositions like ideas about how things
  work
  so it's important that we talk about
  validity
  um validity Works quite a bit
  differently in qualitative research than
  it does in quantitative external
  validity AKA generalizability isn't a
  big concern in qualitative research as
  we already noted transferability is are
  my findings
  useful to other people
  we also care a lot about that the
  findings
  are honest and trustworthy that is what
  validity means in qualitative research
  so there are a couple types of validity
  that we talk about often in qualitative
  research and the first is descriptive
  validity possibly one of the more
  important ones and this is that the
  researcher did not embellish or distort
  the information and that what is
  reported is really what happened
  interpretive validity is that the
  researchers sensitivity and mental
  processes to capture and interpret the
  meanings of what happened is in fact
  legitimate as to what happened
  theoretical validity is perhaps the most
  important some would say and this is how
  much a theoretical explanation that's
  developed through the analysis is
  consistent with the data it can't just
  come from nowhere
  as I mentioned transferability that the
  explanation could apply to other
  situations or populations it could be
  useful to others and then valuation
  validity is the ability to look
  critically at the results
  and the research itself as a way of
  learning and expanding one's
  understanding
  
  so
  how do we do this well we
  compare notes in collaborative research
  we look at trying to do triangulation
  
  we also often will examine exceptions to
  patterns in the data and a version of
  this is negative case analysis cases
  when there was a major deviation from
  other data if a negative case can be
  explained it strengthens the explanation
  of the typical case
  so how this sort of works is that you
  look at data that doesn't fit in okay
  and let's say for example that you were
  studying people who have chronic
  illnesses and how they cope with their
  chronic illnesses you're doing a bunch
  of interviews and you have common themes
  that people say oh you know I have a
  good attitude I have the support and
  loved ones Etc and then you have a
  participant who doesn't say these things
  you've heard a million times that they
  you know rely on their loved ones and
  that they have a good attitude or
  whatever
  and this person is like I actually don't
  feel supported and I have a bad attitude
  about my chronic
  Le this case challenges those themes
  that you've seen emerge and this
  requires you as the researcher to ask
  yourself all right I interviewed Judy
  why was her experience so different than
  everyone else and so you might interview
  Judy a second time to ask more questions
  or you might try to look deeper in the
  data to see if other people had more
  experiences similar to Judy and so by
  thinking about this with the more
  nuanced understanding of her is the
  exception it helps you better understand
  what the major problems are so that's a
  negative case analysis
  another form of validity
  evaluation and qualitative research is
  member checking and that is asking
  participants directly
  if the data that you've found and your
  findings make sense to them maybe you
  don't talk to your participants directly
  you could ask people who are members of
  that community that might be more
  accessible to you versus your original
  participants but either way you check
  with them like does this make sense what
  I found
  so some strengths of qualitative
  research that naturalistic approach
  allowing people to be in their natural
  settings and for people to answer
  questions in their own words means that
  this is very valid because the truth is
  much more embedded within your data of
  what the experiences of those people are
  it also is a subjective and
  contextualized understanding it studies
  people in their own environment with
  their own view of their own worlds
  the flexible research designs really
  great it lends itself to being able to
  study Dynamic situations especially if
  things change that you can change your
  research in a minute to ask different
  questions
  um also as you find out more things you
  can change your project my a classic
  example of this is I went to go do a
  study a number of years ago that I
  really thought that um I was going to be
  studying one thing and I did about three
  weeks of interviews and I realized that
  some of my assumptions were totally
  wrong and I ended up changing my whole
  project in the middle of it because the
  people were telling me something else
  that was much more interesting and I
  ended up doing a bunch of really cool
  interviews about it but thankfully I
  wasn't doing a survey that I couldn't
  have changed it as easily
  some drawbacks of qualitative research
  it's not very efficient it takes a ton
  of time and there is so much data to
  manage people that do quantitative
  research get it done way faster
  qualitative research can take weeks
  months years it's really hard also the
  subjectivity is a concern
  um
  it could be criticized by some as being
  too subjective
  some people don't value qualitative
  research as much because it's subjective
  and I'm sure probably some of you
  um and initially reading some of this
  stuff about qualitative research you're
  like how is this legitimate
  um some quantitative researchers look
  down on qualitative research but I think
  that that's changing qualitative
  research absolutely matters and it's
  getting things that quantitative
  research never could
  so we're going to talk about four types
  of qualitative research I've already
  mentioned interviews quite a bit
  um because it's one that most people are
  familiar with and then we're going to
  talk about a couple other ones really
  briefly
  um so let's first start with ethnography
  ethnography is the description of a
  people and the cultural basis of their
  peoplehood if you've ever seen on
  Discovery Channel or National Geographic
  sort of these shows were like some old
  white dude with a beard goes and lives
  with a tribe for a year and tries to
  learn their ways that is sort of the
  scaffolding on which ethnography was
  based upon with from anthropology
  today it is more complex than that and
  there are a lot of problems with that
  old model of ethnography but that is the
  the tradition
  um we try to study an intact cultural
  group in a natural setting over a period
  of time through observing them
  um we might directly observe them by
  taking notes sometimes people do some
  recordings depends
  in ethnography we believe that some
  things in life can only be observed but
  you have to watch for a really long time
  to get a lot of data points because what
  if that one week You observe that group
  was somehow really exceptional it was
  the week of a holiday or something weird
  happened you gotta watch for a really
  long time
  you have these detailed notes lots of
  data and the goal again is thick
  description
  with a goal of sad you know you're done
  when you've achieved saturation
  ethnography requires you to be really
  flexible but a big downside is that it's
  very difficult to replicate and there
  was a case in the late 80s early 90s
  that this guy who was a linguist you
  know white guy with a beard went and
  lived with this tribe and he made this
  argument about how the tribe's language
  structure like basically that they had
  no past tense in their language
  um but
  you know and then he made a big career
  on this and later like I don't know 20
  years later or something people went
  they were like actually that's not true
  at all so
  you really have to trust that what
  people say is in fact what really
  happened
  um obviously these sort of things don't
  happen that frequently but
  um it is it is a big drawback
  So within ethnography there's different
  ways that we think about the position of
  the actual person doing the research so
  participant observation is a method in
  which a researcher is both an observer
  of and a participant in the culture they
  are examining so this is very
  naturalistic but people need to be aware
  of their Insider Outsider status
  so
  um
  within this there are kind of different
  variations so let's talk about some of
  these differences so one is complete
  participant
  this is when a researcher is definitely
  a member of the group they're studying
  and they are concealing their member
  role so that they will not disrupt the
  natural activity of the group so for
  example imagine that someone is a member
  of a particular religion or a particular
  Club
  they would not disclose this information
  so that
  um no one acts differently
  now participant as Observer is when
  people know that the researcher is an
  observer
  but
  it is less important than their role as
  a group member so for example I have
  this friend sunny and she studies
  korean-american churches she herself is
  korean-american she herself is a
  churchgoer but she also researches this
  group
  when she goes to church
  she is doing research but everyone
  sitting around her isn't thinking about
  Sunny doing research they're thinking
  about Sunny who is korean-american
  is a member of their Church her role as
  a member of that group is more important
  to everybody involved than the fact that
  she's a researcher whereas I a white
  woman who's not a member of that church
  Community if I went in there probably
  people would notice and be like what's
  going on
  so
  um the advantage for people like Sunny
  is she is getting a lot of depth of
  knowledge but it is less confidential
  like if she writes a study up about this
  church like her church members know that
  their dog that she's talking about their
  Church
  um observers participant this is when
  the researchers Observer activities are
  known to the group
  but the research researchers
  participation in the group is very
  secondary to their observation work
  so
  this could be an example of someone
  that's like doing like a teacher
  observation they're not like actively a
  member of the class but they're kind of
  hanging out
  uh in the back I mean they're still
  physically there people notice them but
  they're the fact that they're a
  researcher is primary
  complete Observer is when someone tries
  to remain unobtrusive and does not
  engage with people at all
  and there are different ways to do this
  and one way is a covert Observer
  they are observing and they're publicly
  identified a covert participant is when
  someone's fully immersed in the setting
  without revealing their research
  identity
  so all of these are kind of these
  different ways of thinking thinking
  about these um
  obviously these are not solid categories
  like maybe some people know that Sunny
  is a researcher and other people don't
  Etc but in all of these settings it's
  just thinking about at any time who am I
  in this moment am I an Insider or an
  outsider
  so if you do participate in observation
  which I would totally suggest you do it
  can be really interesting like you can
  go to a park and see how parents and
  kids are playing on the playground or
  whatever
  um you first in your notes you kind of
  set the scene you describe things how
  they are like who's in the park what's
  the noise level what's the weather like
  what's going on
  and then you start identifying actions
  how are people behaving you kind of
  start noticing things about like what's
  going on
  you then identify the actors you're like
  there's this guy here I think he's the
  dad to the kid with the red hat
  um how are people interacting with the
  scene
  you know dad with the kid the kid with
  the red hat is pushing the kid down the
  slide
  where and when do actors interact and
  what events are significant and you're
  just taking notes on all of this
  so where are you doing this well gaining
  access to doing ethnographic observation
  can be really difficult public settings
  like a park as I just mentioned are open
  to everyone you don't have to get
  permission from the people involved
  um you might tell the authorities I
  don't know
  like if there's Park police or something
  you might tell them this is called
  Gatekeepers
  semi-public settings like a store or a
  restaurant or a bar usually demand that
  a person actually do something
  um about the fact that they're there
  observing because people might be
  suspicious if you're just sitting there
  taking notes so you probably should tell
  the owner or the manager what you're
  doing
  and then a private setting like
  someone's home or a private club
  this is not okay for you just to go and
  observe in you have to get formal
  permission and it can be really
  difficult to access so studies that are
  on like a workplace environment and
  stuff are really special because someone
  got access
  there's also unobtrusive observation we
  prefer the people don't know that
  they're being watched they won't change
  their behaviors and there are some other
  ways that you can do this like a
  behavioral Trace study looking at
  artifacts to help you understand
  people's behavior
  um I did this once that we dumped we we
  turned over the trash dumpsters and
  recycling dumpsters at a school to
  understand what the kids were and
  weren't recycling so that's a behavioral
  Trace study
  also disguise field observations that
  you might um
  they know that you're there but they
  don't know what you're doing so if
  you're at that Park taking notes maybe
  they just think you're writing a poem
  so the next type is interview this
  you're probably familiar with already
  it's a process where a researcher a
  participant are engaging in a
  conversation focused on particular
  questions related to a research study
  you can think of it as a conversation
  with a purpose
  what is the purpose to seek to describe
  the meaning that people have experienced
  and make reference to people's
  experiences and their perspectives
  through stories and accounts and
  explanations
  you can get at what people's attitudes
  and beliefs opinions and experiences are
  you can understand the way that they
  describe things in their words
  you can also gather information about
  things that cannot be observed you can
  say you know I saw you do that thing
  over there why did you do that and you
  can also ask about the past
  no I will say interviews are much harder
  than they seem
  and really the best way to do an
  interview is to develop rapport
  you show respect and you agree on the
  rules of the interaction be kind
  um because this will make people feel
  much more comfortable
  interviews are often audio or videotaped
  for transcription but sometimes someone
  might not want it to be audio or
  videotaped so you just have to take good
  notes
  interviews always start with an
  explanation of what your study is and
  getting informed consent questions can
  be asked in various orders I'll show you
  a couple examples in a minute as I said
  they're usually recorded but usually you
  take notes at the same time
  the transcriptions will often be
  analyzed with this particular software
  and researchers will work inductively
  identifying various patterns and themes
  and the goal is to have an analysis that
  has Rich description and theoretical
  conclusions
  there are three main ways that
  interviews are structured first is
  highly structured which the wording of
  the question is predetermined the order
  is predetermined and you ask people the
  same way in the same order every time
  and an example of this are government
  censuses they're like everybody needs to
  be asked what's your job what's your age
  how many people live in this house
  semi-structured is very common and it's
  a mix of more and less structured
  questions everything's flexible and you
  have broader questions with probes that
  are follow-up for more detail there
  might be some questions you ask
  everybody
  um but maybe interviews going in a
  different direction so you end up kind
  of talking about different things
  an unstructured interview is the most
  flexible it's more like a conversation
  we tend only use this when a researcher
  knows almost nothing about a topic
  um why does it keep on going like that
  and uh
  the goal is to learn and this also makes
  people feel really comfortable sometimes
  it can be scary for people when um
  they have you know this list of
  questions in front of them
  so
  the interview guide is a list of topics
  and if you have a semi-structured
  interview specific questions and if you
  have a structured interview all the
  questions and includes the main
  questions and probes so those main
  questions are directly related to your
  research question and the probes are
  things to clarify follow-up Etc
  and oftentimes an interview guide will
  start with a grand tour question then
  ask for a general description of what's
  going on my grand tour question when I
  do studies about people's technology use
  is I'll ask them to tell me about like
  the first social media site they ever
  used and kind of tell me the story of
  that and that works really well because
  I can ask them to reflect upon their
  current use like I'll say oh you know
  you told me when you were a kid and you
  were on whatever site
  um that most of your friends were from
  school can you tell me sort of who
  you're friends with on on these sites
  now and so that allows for a comparison
  
  so our next type is focus group focus
  group is highly related to interview
  except there's multiple people these are
  small group discussions led by a
  moderator usually six to twelve people I
  think six to nine is best I think 12 is
  too many in my opinion usually people
  are seated around a table
  they are selected for a particular
  characteristic and then there's a
  moderator who asks questions and guides
  the discussion
  sometimes there's a mix of people
  sometimes not it depends on the goal
  um usually no more than an hour and you
  really have to have a good moderator
  usually these are video recorded but
  sometimes the researcher is watching
  through a video camera or a two-way
  mirror and might be um sending questions
  into the ear of the moderator possibly
  there's a couple different videos of
  focus groups that I want you to watch
  they're in the syllabus and on canvas
  just to give you a sense of how these
  work and I think that this will be
  helpful for you to kind of see how they
  are
  um a little difficult to manage
  so why would you do a focus group not an
  individual interview well you get more
  people at one time
  and people cue each other so it sort of
  simulates real life if you're asking
  people what's your opinion about a
  particular politician having them all
  cure each other's opinions it kind of uh
  gives you a different kind of data than
  if you're just one-on-one with somebody
  why would you do them well if you need
  information really fast or you're doing
  exploratory research or you're trying to
  get new ideas also if slang matters and
  the way people talk about things
  if participants are easily distracted
  like kids it's easier to do a focus
  group than one-on-one interviews
  um or if it's a special population
  that's hard to access
  um also if you just want to kind of take
  the temperature like how are people
  feeling about this thing and you'll see
  this in the example videos
  so some drawbacks to a focus group
  they can be very difficult to manage
  especially if they're large and there
  can be a cascading effect where maybe
  one or two people have an opinion and
  that opinion becomes so dominant that
  you don't really get to know the other
  opinions
  you also can't really use the focus
  group data to make any assessments about
  what individuals feel it's really about
  what the group said
  and also the group composition can
  matter if there's power or cultural
  differences in the group it can impact
  the study
  focus group questions go in a funnel
  structure that you start out with the
  broad topics and then you funnel down to
  more focused and specific issues and
  then you kind of finish out with
  confirming and validating the main
  points like you would say so you know
  you said such and such can't is that
  really how you feel
  so that's how focus group runs see those
  videos to get a sense of how they really
  work they are pretty wild
  um I am not a big fan I find them to be
  really difficult to manage but maybe
  other people have better experiences
  than me
  so textual analysis
  um this is really just an umbrella term
  that encompasses a ton of types of
  qualitative approaches take a
  qualitative methods class if you want to
  learn more about these but they include
  narrative analysis discourse analysis
  thematic analysis rhetorical criticism
  archival analysis performance studies
  Etc and this is when you are analyzing
  non-living data like social media posts
  news articles TV shows pictures clothes
  whatever and you're focusing on
  categorizing and enumerating and
  establishing relationships amongst the
  among the patterns and that you see in
  the text
  sometimes
  um you're also asking questions about
  how these texts are specifically being
  used in different cultural environments
  so this is very similar to content
  analysis but it's less focused on
  Counting and more about just looking at
  what is inside of this text
  grounded their theory is an inductive
  approach to qualitative data analysis
  that's often used with textual analysis
  that the goal is to discover patterns
  through constant comparisons you're
  comparing each new observation to things
  you've already observed
  interestingly it does not use prior
  literature or Theory to guide your
  coding at all it is all a blank slate
  um people say that they want to use this
  but it's really hard it's always easier
  to have
  um prior literature helping to guide you
  also with textual analysis or grounded
  Theory analysis using this software to
  help you manage your data makes life
  infinitely easier
